# Milestone v1.0 - Project Summary

**Generated:** 2026-06-18  
**Purpose:** Team onboarding and project review  
**Scope:** Current milestone artifacts in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `.planning/STATE.md`, and `.planning/phases/`.

---

## 1. Project Overview

Yune is a Rust input-method engine that preserves predictable classic RIME behavior while building toward local-first, optional AI/LLM assistance. The project uses librime as the external compatibility oracle for user-visible schema behavior, config semantics, candidate output, C ABI expectations, deployment data, and frontend integration, but it keeps the implementation idiomatic Rust rather than cloning librime's internal C++ architecture.

The milestone strengthened the compatibility foundation in two arcs:

- **Classic RIME compatibility foundation:** ABI-backed CLI/frontend validation, native loader behavior, schema-loaded processor/translator/filter depth, compiled dictionary payloads, userdb storage/learning, and benchmark baselines.
- **TypeDuck-Web browser integration foundation:** a WASM/export contract, TypeScript runtime wrapper, browser virtual filesystem/persistence helpers, and upstream TypeDuck-Web seam analysis with browser E2E scaffolding.

The milestone reached **35/35 completed plans across 10 phases**. The final TypeDuck-Web recommendation is **NO-GO for AI-native frontend exposure** until browser validation can actually run. The blocker is practical and bounded: missing WASM artifact generation/tooling and explicit asset configuration, not a known fundamental Yune/TypeDuck seam incompatibility.

## 2. Architecture & Technical Decisions

- **Decision:** Keep librime as the behavior oracle, not the architecture template.  
  **Why:** Existing schemas and frontends depend on librime contracts, while Rust can model internals through smaller typed modules.  
  **Phase:** Project baseline, reinforced throughout.

- **Decision:** Drive frontend compatibility through `yune-rime-api` and the exported `RimeApi` table.  
  **Why:** Frontends consume the C ABI boundary, so CLI and native validation must exercise setup, initialize, schema selection, session lifecycle, key processing, context/status reads, and memory freeing through ABI calls.  
  **Phase:** 1, 2, 6.

- **Decision:** Treat runtime resource names as logical IDs before joining filesystem paths.  
  **Why:** C APIs and schema YAML can otherwise smuggle path traversal, absolute paths, or platform separators into runtime data access.  
  **Phase:** 2 and carried into dictionary/browser helpers.

- **Decision:** Own compiled dictionary parsing in `yune-core`, with runtime selection in `yune-rime-api`.  
  **Why:** Binary payload parsing is engine data behavior; schema installation should choose validated resources and fall back explicitly, not own byte formats.  
  **Phase:** 4.

- **Decision:** Implement userdb behavior as a typed file-backed compatibility abstraction, not full LevelDB binary compatibility.  
  **Why:** The phase needed observable storage, sync, recovery, learning, and ranking semantics without pulling in LevelDB internals or C ABI pointer ownership.  
  **Phase:** 5.

- **Decision:** Validate real/front-end-shaped behavior with minimized traces and blockers before broad OS integration.  
  **Why:** Native GUI/input-method hosts and browser worker environments require platform setup; deterministic host-shaped fixtures make gaps reviewable and reproducible.  
  **Phase:** 6.

- **Decision:** Use `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` and an adapter-owned `yune_typeduck_*` export list for browser integration.  
  **Why:** TypeDuck-Web-style integration needs C ABI exports and Emscripten filesystem/runtime hooks, not a `wasm-bindgen` contract.  
  **Phase:** 7.

- **Decision:** Keep the TypeScript bridge package-local under `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime`.  
  **Why:** The repository previously had no root JS workspace; the browser adapter needed a narrow testable wrapper, not app scaffolding.  
  **Phase:** 8.

- **Decision:** Keep browser filesystem setup host-owned and explicit.  
  **Why:** Missing schemas, dictionaries, sync failures, and stale deployed config must be visible integration failures, not hidden by fake assets or network fetches.  
  **Phase:** 9.

- **Decision:** Patch TypeDuck-Web minimally and classify blockers separately.  
  **Why:** The final findings need to distinguish upstream app/source blockers, Yune adapter/runtime mismatches, and environment/tooling blockers before AI-native work can depend on frontend evidence.  
  **Phase:** 10.

## 4. Requirements Coverage

The requirements file contains some stale checkbox/status rows, but the phase summaries and verification reports show the following milestone state.

### Satisfied Or Verified

- **CLI-01 through CLI-05:** ABI-backed CLI frontend setup, schema deployment/selection, session lifecycle, key processing, rendering, and transcript replay were delivered in Phase 1.
- **ABI-01 through ABI-04:** Native loader validation, ABI/runtime regression coverage, resource-ID validation, and repeated lifecycle determinism were delivered in Phase 2.
- **SCHEMA-01 through SCHEMA-03:** Deeper schema-loaded speller/editor/navigator/selector/chord/shape/punctuation/fallback coverage was delivered in Phase 3.
- **DATA-01 through DATA-04:** Phase 4 verification passed 4/4 must-haves for compiled payload readers, rebuild behavior, advanced dictionary data, and correction/tolerance lookup.
- **USERDB-01 through USERDB-03 and QUAL-03 through QUAL-04:** Phase 5 verification passed 5/5 must-haves.
- **FRONTEND-VALIDATION-01 through FRONTEND-VALIDATION-05 and BENCH-01 through BENCH-02:** Phase 6 verification passed.
- **TYPEDUCK-WASM-01 through TYPEDUCK-WASM-03:** Phase 7 verification passed.
- **TYPEDUCK-JS-01 through TYPEDUCK-JS-04:** Phase 8 summaries record wrapper APIs, response/free pairing, key mapping tests, and lifecycle documentation as completed.
- **TYPEDUCK-FS-01 through TYPEDUCK-FS-04:** Phase 9 verification passed 6/6 must-haves.
- **TYPEDUCK-E2E-01, TYPEDUCK-E2E-02, and TYPEDUCK-E2E-04:** Phase 10 captured upstream source/seam metadata, produced the Yune seam patch, and wrote the final recommendation.

### Partial Or Blocked

- **SCHEMA-04 and SCHEMA-05:** Remaining librime gear, full distribution-scale behavior, and full OpenCC/correction/tolerance parity are represented through compatibility increments and structured deferrals rather than complete parity.
- **QUAL-01 and QUAL-02:** The milestone followed the ownership rule in new work, but the requirements file still marks these as pending and should be reconciled during milestone completion.
- **TYPEDUCK-E2E-03:** Real browser validation flows were specified and scaffolded, but all flows are BLOCKED because the WASM artifact could not be generated in the local environment.

### Audit Status

No milestone audit artifact was present at generation time. Verification artifacts exist for Phases 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Phase 10 closes through final findings, blocker taxonomy, and recommendation gates rather than a separate verification file.

## 5. Key Decisions Log

- **D-01, Phase 1:** Add an ABI-backed frontend path in `yune-cli` instead of continuing to validate only through direct `yune-core` fixtures.
- **D-02, Phase 2:** Validate the exported `RimeApi` function table through a real loadable dynamic artifact.
- **D-05, Phase 3:** Make remaining librime gear visible through compatibility increments or structured deferrals.
- **D-03, Phase 4:** Keep compiled payload parsing in `crates/yune-core/src/dictionary/`, with schema/runtime code only selecting resources and installing dictionaries.
- **D-12, Phase 5:** Keep AI/native ranker work out of userdb learning; userdb compatibility is not a substitute for future AI memory.
- **D-15, Phase 6:** End frontend validation with a go/no-go recommendation before AI-native candidate/ranking design.
- **D-01, Phase 7:** Use `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` as the browser build target for TypeDuck-Web-style integration.
- **D-07, Phase 8:** Centralize response handling so every non-null owned adapter response is freed exactly once.
- **D-08, Phase 9:** Treat persistence sync as an explicit host-owned operation before init and after deploy/customize/userdb-changing boundaries.
- **D-12, Phase 10:** Separate final findings into TypeDuck-Web app/source blockers, Yune adapter/runtime mismatches, and environment/tooling blockers.
- **D-13, Phase 10:** Base AI-native frontend exposure on real frontend readiness evidence.
- **D-14, Phase 10:** Keep AI-native provider calls, candidate generation, ranking, context, memory, privacy controls, and new first-party frontend work deferred.

## 6. Tech Debt & Deferred Items

- **Browser validation blocker:** TypeDuck-Web browser E2E could not run because cargo/rustup/emcc and the WASM artifact generation path were unavailable or incomplete in the validation environment.
- **TypeDuck-Web asset blocker:** The patched TypeDuck-Web worker still needs explicit real YAML asset configuration; fake fallback data is intentionally forbidden.
- **Adapter/runtime mismatches:** TypeDuckContext property defaults, the `setOption` API gap, and customize bitmap behavior are documented as accepted or bounded mismatches, not hidden as passing browser evidence.
- **Compiled dictionary limits:** Phase 4 intentionally rejects unsupported MARISA string tables, Darts double arrays, reverse MARISA tries, and multi-level phrase indexes structurally.
- **Userdb limit:** The storage implementation is a typed file-backed compatibility abstraction, not full LevelDB binary compatibility.
- **Frontend scope:** Squirrel/macOS and Linux frontend validation are represented by source-modeled fixtures and documented blockers, not direct OS input-method installation.
- **Requirements hygiene:** `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` has stale pending checkboxes for several items that phase artifacts mark complete. Reconcile it during `$gsd-complete-milestone`.
- **State hygiene:** `.planning/STATE.md` contains stale current-position prose from earlier phases even though artifact counts show 35/35 plans complete.
- **AI-native layer:** Provider interfaces, candidate generation, ranking, context policy, memory, privacy, and a new first-party Yune frontend remain future milestone work.
