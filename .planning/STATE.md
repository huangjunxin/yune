# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-28)

**Core value:** Existing RIME schemas and frontends should behave predictably through Yune's Rust implementation, with every compatibility difference measurable against librime before it is accepted.
**Current focus:** Phase 06 — real-frontend-validation-and-benchmark

## Current Position

Phase: 6 (06) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Next phase: 6 (Real Frontend Validation And Benchmark)
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-05-01

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 18
- Planned Phase 06 plans: 4
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: -

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3/3 | - | - |
| 02 | 3/3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 02-01, 02-03, 02-02
- Trend: Phase 2 completed after verification gap closure

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Existing `docs/analysis.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`,
  `docs/refactor-plan.md`, and `.planning/codebase/` are the source context for
  this GSD project.

- Initialization: External research was skipped for setup because current scope
  is driven by existing project docs and direct librime comparison.

- Initialization: Future compatibility slices must choose module ownership,
  test ownership, and librime comparison target before implementation.

- Phase 2: Native ABI validation uses a Cargo integration-test dynamic loader,
  resolves `rime_get_api`, and exercises the returned `RimeApi` function table
  against the real Cargo-built `yune-rime-api` cdylib.

- Phase 2: Runtime safety fixes are limited to ABI/runtime boundaries; schema
  semantics, compiled dictionary behavior, and userdb storage compatibility stay
  deferred to later phases.

- 03-01: Non-auto previous-match splitting is owned in processors/speller.rs without lib.rs dispatch changes.
- 03-01: Existing editor/navigator/selector and chord/punctuation/fallback behavior is now locked by schema-loaded ABI fixtures.
- 04-03: Represent advanced source and compiled dictionary data on TableDictionary instead of parallel runtime-specific structs.
- 04-03: Use bounded local Yune fixture markers for Phase 04 advanced compiled payload parity while rejecting unsupported librime sections structurally.
- 04-03: Carry compiled reverse dict_settings into runtime table dictionaries so ReverseLookupTranslator observes source and compiled settings through the same API.
- 04-03: Keep LevelDB/userdb learning, predictive updates, plugin translators, and AI-native ranking out of DATA-03.
- 04-04: Correction/tolerance data is represented as normalized TableDictionary metadata and merged through compiled/source dictionary paths.
- 04-04: Lookup expansion preserves original input first, then correction canonicalization, then tolerance candidates.
- 04-04: Correction/tolerance parser counts are capped before allocation and malformed compiled sections fall back with structured diagnostics.
- 06-03: Squirrel/macOS validation is represented as a source-modeled RimeApi lifecycle fixture plus documented direct-run blocker rather than a mandatory app bundle or input-method registration step.
- 06-03: Linux ibus-rime and fcitx-rime validation remains follow-up documentation with safe ABI source-model markers in native_frontends.rs, not a required daemon dependency for cargo test.
- 06-03: Native frontend mismatch capture continues to reuse the Phase 06 host trace schema and sanitized fixture rules instead of inventing a new target-specific trace format.
- Frontend benchmark baselines use a dependency-free Cargo bench target instead of Criterion to preserve MSRV safety and avoid unnecessary benchmark infrastructure.
- BENCH-01/BENCH-02 measurements stay at the rime_get_api / RimeApi function-table boundary rather than direct yune-core calls.
- AI-native readiness is GO WITH CONDITIONS, based on Phase 6 validation and benchmarks while keeping providers, rankers, context policy, memory policy, and privacy controls out of scope.

### Pending Todos

- Execute Phase 06 — real-frontend-validation-and-benchmark — 4 verified plans.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Real frontend validation may require host-specific setup outside the Rust workspace.
- AI-native input layer remains deferred until Phase 06 produces a go/no-go recommendation.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
