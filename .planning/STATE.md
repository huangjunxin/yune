# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-28)

**Core value:** Existing RIME schemas and frontends should behave predictably through Yune's Rust implementation, with every compatibility difference measurable against librime before it is accepted.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Schema Pipeline Depth

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (Native ABI Validation And Runtime Safety) — COMPLETE
Next phase: 3 (Schema Pipeline Depth)
Status: Ready for Phase 3 discussion/planning
Last activity: 2026-04-29 -- Phase 2 verified and secured

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 35%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: -

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3/3 | - | - |
| 02 | 3/3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 02-01, 02-03, 02-02
- Trend: Phase 2 completed after verification gap closure

*Updated after each phase completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Existing `docs/analysis.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`,
  `docs/refactor-plan.md`, and `.planning/codebase/` are the source context for
  this GSD project.

- Initialization: External research was skipped for setup because current scope
  is driven by existing project docs and direct librime comparison.

- Initialization: Future compatibility slices must choose module ownership,
  test ownership, and librime comparison target before implementation.

- Phase 2: Native ABI validation uses a Cargo integration-test dynamic loader,
  resolves `rime_get_api`, and exercises the returned `RimeApi` function table
  against the real Cargo-built `yune-rime-api` cdylib.

- Phase 2: Runtime safety fixes are limited to ABI/runtime boundaries; schema
  semantics, compiled dictionary behavior, and userdb storage compatibility stay
  deferred to later phases.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Schema semantic depth remains intentionally deferred to Phase 3.
- Compiled dictionary payload consumption remains deferred to Phase 4.
- LevelDB/userdb storage compatibility remains deferred to Phase 5.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Plugin compatibility | librime C++ plugin ABI, Lua, octagram, predict, proto | Deferred | Initialization |
| Product frontend | New graphical end-user frontend | Deferred | Initialization |
| AI extension layer | Production local model bridge and opt-in contextual suggestions | Deferred | Initialization |
| Schema semantics | Deeper librime gear behavior beyond ABI/runtime safety | Deferred | Phase 2 |
| Compiled data | `.table.bin`, `.prism.bin`, `.reverse.bin` payload consumption | Deferred | Phase 2 |
| UserDB storage | LevelDB/userdb compatibility beyond plain text shim | Deferred | Phase 2 |
