# TypeDuck v1.1.2 Oracle Fixtures

These fixtures were captured from the real TypeDuck fork so later Yune behavior
changes do not guess candidate comment bytes.

## Capture Notes

The schema archive was expanded into a scratch shared-data directory under
`target/typeduck-oracle/v1.1.2/`, then compiled with:

```powershell
rime_deployer.exe --build <user_data_dir> <shared_data_dir> <user_data_dir>\build
```

The capture caller loaded `rime.dll` with modules:

```text
default
dictionary_lookup
```

It selected `jyut6ping3_mobile`, sent the ASCII input sequences in
`jyut6ping3-mobile-comments.json`, and recorded schema identity, composition
state, menu metadata, and selected candidate records from the returned
`RimeContext`.

The `comment` fields intentionally preserve the raw fork bytes as JSON escapes,
including leading `\f`, record separators `\r`, and multilingual dictionary
columns. Do not normalize these strings when using them as goldens.

`reverse-lookup-prompt.json` was captured from the same local v1.1.2 binary with
a scratch schema that has an affix reverse-lookup prompt named `HR6 粵語`, one
lookup row (`火	huo`) and two target rows (`火	ho`, `火	huo`). It locks the
fork's `"; "` multi-pronunciation joiner and prompt/preedit bytes for the HR-6
parity slice.
