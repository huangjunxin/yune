# M37 Engine Hyper-Optimization Plan

> **Status:** Planned - **Milestone:** M37 (engine hyper-optimization) - **Created:** 2026-06-24 - **Type:** engine-performance plan
>
> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make the post-M36 engine path meaningfully closer to librime by landing a working native mmap-backed `rsmarisa` table path and fixing candidate materialization/context export for the TypeDuck product path, with `hai` as the first residual row to explain and move.

**Architecture:** M37 is not another narrow storage no-go milestone. It has three hard closeout gates: (1) `rsmarisa` must be integrated into the real product compiled-table path, (2) native product tables must use an mmap-backed `rsmarisa` loading mode with evidence, and (3) the candidate materialization/context path must become page-bounded for the measured TypeDuck product rows instead of eagerly materializing and cloning the whole candidate list. The implementation remains oracle-driven and ABI-stable: default `RimeApi`/`RimeCandidate` layouts do not change, TypeDuck profile behavior stays byte-identical, and full-list readers keep an explicit eager expansion path when they truly need one.

**Tech Stack:** Rust (`yune-core`, `yune-rime-api`), `rsmarisa`, `StaticTableTranslator`, `TableLookup`, `CompactTableStore`, `Engine`, `CandidateRequest`/`TranslationResult`, `RimeGetContext`, `schema_install`, `table_writer`, `compiled_table`, `compiled_prism`, `native_inprocess_benchmark`, upstream `luna_pinyin` fixtures, TypeDuck `jyut6ping3` fixtures, and TypeDuck-Web runtime/browser gates only when runtime-visible files change.

---

## Why This Exists

M33-M36 removed real costs, but the M36 diagnosis still leaves two unacceptable gaps for a hyper-optimized engine:

- **`rsmarisa` is not landed, and native mmap is still unproven.** M36 proved that the shipped TypeDuck product blobs use a marisa string table, then closed `rsmarisa` by no-go for that milestone and shipped a no-marisa Yune-readable re-emitted fallback. That was a useful product unblock, but it is not the final data path. M37 must make `rsmarisa` work on real TypeDuck product table data and must prove the native path loads the marisa payload through mmap mode. This does not assume `rsmarisa` or mmap is the top `hai` latency owner; it makes the final storage shape non-negotiable.
- **Candidate materialization is still eager for the product.** The final M36 `hai` row is the clearest clue: it is the shortest product input, barely improved (`-29.2%`), and remains about `3x` slower than the other final TypeDuck rows. That points to completion/homophone explosion, full-list sort/filter/userdb merge, owned candidate construction, context snapshot clone, and ABI C-string export, not long-sentence DP.

M37 therefore turns the M36 follow-up strategy into a closeable implementation milestone. It starts with attribution, but attribution alone cannot close it. The milestone remains open until `rsmarisa` is active, native product rows prove mmap-mode marisa loading, and the measured product key rows prove page-bounded materialization.

Sequencing rule: the hard gates are not a ranking. Phase 0 decides the
implementation order. If `hai` is dominated by context export or candidate
materialization, execute Task 2/Task 3 before broad storage work while keeping
Task 1 open as a non-waivable storage/data-path closeout gate.

## Scope

In scope:

- Fresh M37 baseline and per-owner attribution for Track A (`luna_pinyin` Yune vs librime) and Track B (`jyut6ping3_mobile` Yune before/after), starting with Track B `hai`.
- A real native mmap-backed `rsmarisa` product table path for TypeDuck `jyut6ping3` and `jyut6ping3_scolar`.
- Reading real marisa string-table payloads from actual TypeDuck product `.table.bin` files.
- Emitting or rebuilding fresh product table artifacts that use `rsmarisa` for the string table while still carrying every Yune/TypeDuck payload needed for rich comments, lookup records, correction/tolerance, and source checksum freshness.
- Native `rsmarisa::Trie::mmap()` product-path loading with evidence. If upstream `rsmarisa`, the current file layout, or lifetime ownership blocks direct mmap, M37 continues with a reviewed local patch, fork, or owner-backed mmap adapter; it does not close by no-go.
- Browser/WASM byte-backed loading using `Trie::map()` or an owned safe adapter if `map()`'s static-lifetime API is insufficient. Browser/WASM does not require OS mmap, but it must not force the native path back to owned no-marisa storage.
- Removing full-list candidate materialization from page-only product reads: translator output, engine merge/sort/filter/userdb/ranker work, context snapshot, and ABI export must be bounded to the visible page plus measured surplus where semantics allow it.
- Eager fallback for behaviors that truly require full-list semantics, but not for the default measured product `hai`, `ngohaig`, `loengjathau`, and `jigaajiusihaa` rows.
- Conservative report updates that keep Track A, Track B, native, browser, latency, and memory claims separate.

Out of scope:

- Widening default `RimeApi`, `RimeCandidate`, or TypeDuck profile ABI structs.
- Changing candidate order, rich comment bytes, learning behavior, partial selection, default-confirm recomposition, or TypeDuck profile options to make performance easier.
- Replacing Yune's deterministic engine with librime's C++ component model.
- Treating `typeduck.hk/web`, `LibreService/my_rime`, or stock librime browser delivery as a behavior oracle.
- M31 public-demo Cloudflare/PWA/cache/UI work, except for running browser gates if M37 changes runtime-visible WASM behavior.
- M32 AI product UX and P2-WIN-01 TSF/frontend-shell work.

## Non-Negotiable Closeout Gates

- `M37-ENGINE-01` (attribution): The Phase 0 evidence must split Track B `hai` across process-key, translator lookup, completion enumeration, candidate materialization, global sort/top-K, filters, userdb merge, context snapshot, ABI allocation/free, and working-set owners. If `hai` is not explained, implementation continues.
- `M37-ENGINE-02` (`rsmarisa` hard gate): `rsmarisa` must be a real dependency or a reviewed in-repo patched/forked equivalent, selected by the product table path, and proven against actual `jyut6ping3` and `jyut6ping3_scolar` table data. A second "measured no-go" for `rsmarisa` does not close M37.
- `M37-ENGINE-03` (fresh product compiled path): The final product status must show fresh table/prism/reverse artifacts, no `SourceFallback`, and a table parse/status that proves the `rsmarisa` path is active rather than silently using the M36 no-marisa fallback.
- `M37-ENGINE-10` (native mmap hard gate): The final native product path must report mmap-mode `rsmarisa` loading for the marisa string-table payload. If direct `Trie::mmap()` cannot own the required lifetime or file slice safely, M37 must land a reviewed local patch/fork or owner-backed mmap adapter before closeout. A native owned-buffer, no-marisa, or "mmap no-go" result keeps M37 open.
- `M37-ENGINE-04` (candidate materialization hard gate): For the default Track B product rows, instrumentation must prove Yune materializes only the current page plus bounded surplus during ordinary `RimeProcessKey` + `RimeGetContext` reads. Full-list materialization is allowed only when an explicit full-list API, paging beyond the retained window, debug inspection, or a proven full-list-only feature asks for it.
- `M37-ENGINE-05` (context export): `RimeGetContext` must no longer require `Engine::snapshot()` to clone the full candidate list for page-only reads. It should read a page snapshot or page view and allocate C strings only for the exported page.
- `M37-ENGINE-06` (behavior): `upstream_luna_pinyin_parity`, `cantonese_parity`, `typeduck_web`, M28 long-composition/default-confirm coverage, paging, deletion, numbered selection, click selection, userdb learning, correction, prediction, and rich dictionary comments remain byte-identical for their target fixtures.
- `M37-ENGINE-07` (measured product movement): Track B `hai` must move materially from the M36 final `15,241.000 us` median and may not remain the unexplained worst row by about `3x`. If the first materialization fix does not move it, continue with the next measured owner before closing.
- `M37-ENGINE-08` (honest public claims): Native wins are not browser wins without rebuilt release WASM and real browser evidence. Track A ratios remain comparison caveats unless they independently improve.
- `M37-ENGINE-09` (quality gates): `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, focused upstream and TypeDuck parity tests, `cargo test --workspace`, final native benchmarks, report/docs checks, and `git diff --check` pass. Runtime/browser/patch gates run when runtime-visible files change.

## File Responsibilities

- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and crate manifests: own the `rsmarisa` dependency choice, version pin, feature flags, license note, MSRV check, and any local patch/fork override.

- `crates/yune-rime-api/src/context_api.rs`: owns `RimeGetContext` page export and C-string allocation/free behavior.
- `crates/yune-rime-api/src/schema_install.rs`: owns deployed artifact selection, product path activation, runtime fallback prevention, and profile guardrails.
- `crates/yune-rime-api/benches/native_inprocess_benchmark.rs`: owns Track A/Track B benchmark rows, product path status, mmap-mode status, and new per-owner instrumentation output.
- `docs/reports/evidence/m37-engine-hyper-optimization/`: owns all M37 evidence.

## Task 0 - Baseline, Owner Spans, And `hai` Attribution

**Files:**

- Read: `docs/reports/yune-vs-librime-performance.md`

- [ ] **Step 0.1: Confirm repo state**

Run:

```powershell
git fetch origin --prune
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -5 --decorate
```

Expected:

- Worktree is clean or unrelated active changes are listed before editing.
- The current branch includes the M36 closeout and the post-M36 performance diagnosis commit.

- [ ] **Step 0.2: Capture fresh M37 baseline**

Run the M36 native in-process benchmark with the same Track A/Track B split:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\benchmark-native-rime-inprocess.ps1 -OutputRoot docs\reports\evidence\m37-engine-hyper-optimization\phase-0-baseline -Iterations 5 -SessionIterations 20 -KeyIterations 20 -DeployProductBeforeBenchmark
```

Expected:

- Baseline CSVs include Track A `ni`, `hao`, `zhongguo`, startup, session, and Track B `hai`, `ngohaig`, `loengjathau`, `jigaajiusihaa`.
- Any drift from M36 final is recorded before optimizing.

- [ ] **Step 0.3: Add owner spans for the key path**

Instrument the native harness or an internal feature-gated timing path so each product key sample can report:

- per-key processing excluding context read
- translator lookup
- completion/prefix enumeration
- candidate view to owned-candidate materialization
- sort or top-K
- filter pipeline
- userdb predictive merge
- ranker/AI merge if active
- context snapshot/page snapshot
- ABI C-string allocation and `free_context`

Expected:

- `hai-attribution.md` names the top owner for `hai`.
- If `hai` is dominated by context export rather than lookup, Task 2 is prioritized before broader materialization/storage work.

- [ ] **Step 0.4: Add materialization counters**

Record, per key row:

- dictionary candidates enumerated
- `LookupCandidate` views visited
- owned `Candidate` values constructed
- candidates sorted or considered by top-K
- candidates stored in engine context
- candidates cloned by snapshot/page snapshot
- C ABI `RimeCandidate` values exported

Expected:

- The baseline proves whether `hai` creates a large completion/homophone set even though it is only three keys.
- The final M37 run can prove materialization reduction with counts, not only latency.

## Task 1 - Land `rsmarisa` For The Real Product Table Path

Task numbering is not a command to optimize storage before the measured top
owner. After Task 0, run this task before or after Task 2/Task 3 according to
the `hai` attribution. It remains a hard M37 closeout gate either way.

**Files:**

- Modify: `Cargo.toml`
- Modify: `Cargo.lock`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/Cargo.toml`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/dictionary/mod.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/dictionary/compiled_table.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/dictionary/table_writer.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-rime-api/src/schema_install.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-rime-api/benches/native_inprocess_benchmark.rs`

- Test: `crates/yune-core/src/tests/dictionary.rs`
- Create: `docs/reports/evidence/m37-engine-hyper-optimization/rsmarisa-path.md`

- [ ] **Step 1.1: Pin and verify `rsmarisa`**

Check the current `rsmarisa` crate, then pin a version that satisfies the repo's MSRV, license, Windows, Linux, and WASM requirements. The currently documented API includes `Trie::mmap`, `Trie::map`, `Trie::reverse_lookup`, `Trie::predictive_search`, `Trie::num_tries`, and `Trie::num_keys`; verify those names at execution time before coding. Treat native mmap support as a required capability, not a nice-to-have benchmark variant.

Expected:

- `rsmarisa-path.md` records crate version, license, MSRV result, feature flags, Windows/native result, and WASM result.
- If upstream `rsmarisa` has a bug or lifetime blocker, M37 continues by using a reviewed local patch/fork or small owner-backed mmap adapter. Do not close M37 by declaring `rsmarisa` or mmap no-go.

- [ ] **Step 1.2: Add a marisa string-table adapter**

Implement a narrow adapter that can:

- locate the existing `string_table_offset` and `string_table_size` fields in a real `.table.bin`
- mmap only that marisa payload on native, without reading the whole table into an owned buffer
- map or load the same payload on WASM/browser through the safest supported byte-backed API
- reverse-lookup a string id into UTF-8 text through `rsmarisa`
- report `num_tries`, `num_keys`, tail mode, node order, and mapping mode for evidence; native final evidence must say `mapping_mode=mmap`
- keep byte ownership safe on native and WASM

Expected:

- Real `jyut6ping3.table.bin` and `jyut6ping3_scolar.table.bin` tests can recover sampled strings by id through native mmap mode.
- If `Trie::mmap()` cannot map an interior payload slice directly, the implementation adds a safe owner-backed mmap adapter, local patch, or fork rather than copying the payload into a normal owned buffer or falling back to no-marisa.
- If `Trie::map(&'static [u8])` is too restrictive for runtime-loaded WASM bytes, the implementation adds a safe owner-backed solution rather than leaking per-load buffers or falling back to no-marisa.

- [ ] **Step 1.3: Teach `compiled_table.rs` to parse marisa-backed table entries**

Replace the hard rejection of `marisa string_table` with a dual resolver:

- plain current C-string/self-relative offsets for no-marisa Yune tables
- `rsmarisa` reverse lookup for marisa-backed table string ids

Expected:

- Existing no-marisa compact table tests still pass.
- New tests prove the real product table can parse candidate text through `rsmarisa`.
- Unsupported multi-level index, advanced payload, correction/tolerance, and lookup-record gaps remain structured errors unless the selected fresh product build supplies those payloads separately.

- [ ] **Step 1.4: Emit fresh rsmarisa-backed product tables**

Update the table writer or product deploy path so `workspace_update:<schema>` can create fresh product tables whose string table is rsmarisa-backed and whose checksum matches source. Preserve the M36 lesson: the final passing path must be a coherent table/prism/reverse set, not an isolated table shortcut.

Expected:

- Fresh `jyut6ping3.table.bin` and `jyut6ping3_scolar.table.bin` have nonzero marisa string-table fields.
- `product_path_status.csv` reports fresh checksum, table parse through `rsmarisa`, native `mapping_mode=mmap`, prism parse ok, reverse parse ok, and `compiled_ready=true`.
- Final runtime path does not use source-YAML fallback or the M36 no-marisa final fallback.

- [ ] **Step 1.5: Prove behavior byte parity**

Run focused gates:

```powershell
cargo test -p yune-core --test cantonese_parity -- --nocapture
cargo test -p yune-rime-api --test typeduck_web -- --nocapture
cargo test -p yune-core compiled_payloads -- --nocapture
```

Expected:

- TypeDuck rich comments, lookup records, correction/tolerance, long composition, partial selection, default-confirm recomposition, and userdb learning stay byte-identical.
- `rsmarisa-path.md` records mmap-mode evidence and any crate patch/fork/adapter with why it remains safe.

## Task 2 - Remove Full Snapshot Cloning From Page-Only Context Reads

**Files:**

- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/engine.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/state.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-rime-api/src/context_api.rs`
- Test: `crates/yune-rime-api/tests/frontend_client/`
- Test: `crates/yune-rime-api/tests/frontend_hosts/`
- Create: `docs/reports/evidence/m37-engine-hyper-optimization/context-page-export.md`

- [ ] **Step 2.1: Add a page snapshot API**

Add an internal engine API for page-only reads, shaped around the current menu page size and highlighted index. It should clone only:

- composition/status/preedit data needed by `RimeGetContext`
- the visible page candidates
- candidate-list completeness and page metadata

Expected:

- `Engine::snapshot()` remains available for full snapshot callers.
- `RimeGetContext` can use the page snapshot without cloning the entire `Vec<Candidate>`.

- [ ] **Step 2.2: Route `RimeGetContext` through page export**

Update `context_api.rs` so ordinary context reads export only the page view. Preserve hidden-candidate mode, select labels, select keys, commit text preview, chord prompt, affix prompt, `is_last_page`, and highlighted index behavior.

Expected:

- Existing frontend-client and frontend-host tests pass.
- The materialization counters show full candidate-list clone count drops to zero for ordinary page reads.

- [ ] **Step 2.3: Keep full-list readers explicit**

Audit callers that require a full candidate list and route them through `ensure_complete_candidate_list()` or `Engine::snapshot()` intentionally.

Expected:

- Debug inspector, candidate iterators, out-of-window paging, and selection beyond retained window remain correct.
- `context-page-export.md` lists each full-list caller and why it is still eager.

## Task 3 - Page-Bound Product Candidate Materialization

**Files:**

- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/dictionary/query_table.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/translator/mod.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/engine.rs`
- Test: `crates/yune-core/src/tests/translator.rs`
- Test: `crates/yune-core/src/tests/engine.rs`
- Test: `crates/yune-core/tests/cantonese_parity.rs`
- Create: `docs/reports/evidence/m37-engine-hyper-optimization/materialization-gate.md`

- [ ] **Step 3.1: Replace boxed table iterators on the hot path**

If Phase 0 shows iterator dispatch is measurable, replace `TableStorage`'s boxed iterator returns with concrete enum iterators for heap, compact, and rsmarisa-backed stores.

Expected:

- No behavior change.
- This step is skipped only if Phase 0 proves it is not measurable; skipping it does not waive the materialization hard gate.

- [ ] **Step 3.2: Make TypeDuck product rows eligible for bounded requests**

Generalize the M34 bounded refresh gate past `luna_pinyin` only after proving the default TypeDuck product rows are safe. The first target set is:

- `hai`
- `ngohaig`
- `loengjathau`
- `jigaajiusihaa`

Expected:

- These rows use bounded materialization under the default product options measured by the native harness.
- Full-list-sensitive settings keep eager fallback with explicit evidence.

- [ ] **Step 3.3: Bound sort and merge work**

Replace full-list `sort_by` with a stable page-sized top-K or k-way merge where the request is bounded. Keep tie behavior deterministic and byte-identical for the first page.

Expected:

- First page, paging, selection, and default confirm are unchanged.
- Materialization counters prove only page plus surplus is sorted/materialized for default product rows.

- [ ] **Step 3.4: Classify filters, userdb, rankers, and prediction**

For each product feature, classify it as:

- page-safe
- surplus-safe
- full-list-only

At minimum classify `charset_filter`, rich dictionary lookup comments, userdb predictive merge, correction/tolerance, prefix fallback, `prediction_never_first`, `prediction_candidate_limit`, sentence-over-completion, and AI staged merge.

Expected:

- Page-safe and surplus-safe features use bounded work.
- Full-list-only features force explicit eager fallback and are named in `materialization-gate.md`.

- [ ] **Step 3.5: Prove the `hai` hard gate**

Run the native product key row repeatedly after the materialization change.

Expected:

- `hai` has a clear before/after reduction from the M37 baseline.
- `hai` no longer remains the unexplained `3x` outlier.
- If `hai` remains dominated by a new owner, continue with the next measured owner before closing M37.

## Task 4 - Index Remaining Full-List Product Owners

**Files:**

- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/translator/mod.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/dictionary/compiled_prism.rs`
- Modify: `crates/yune-core/src/engine.rs`
- Test: `crates/yune-core/tests/cantonese_parity.rs`
- Test: `crates/yune-rime-api/tests/typeduck_web.rs`
- Create: `docs/reports/evidence/m37-engine-hyper-optimization/full-list-owner-indexes.md`

- [ ] **Step 4.1: Remove dynamic-correction all-code scans where measured**

If Phase 0 or Task 3 identifies correction scans as a top owner, add length/syllable buckets and reusable restricted-distance scratch space so `dynamic_correction_lookup` no longer requires scanning every code for ordinary product rows.

Expected:

- Correction-on TypeDuck rows improve or the evidence proves correction is not the current top owner.
- Default non-correction rows do not regress.

- [ ] **Step 4.2: Index prefix fallback and prediction-limit metadata**

If prefix fallback or prediction limits block bounding for product rows, add enough metadata to decide the first page without materializing the whole candidate list.

Expected:

- `prediction_never_first`, `assign_ordered_candidate_qualities`, and sentence-over-completion remain explicit stop gates. If one requires a full list, that ring stays eager and documented.

- [ ] **Step 4.3: Replace sentence path cloning only if measured**

If sentence/path DP appears as a top owner after materialization is bounded, replace `Vec<String>` path cloning with backpointers or piece ids.

Expected:

- This is not a default assumption. It lands only if measurement shows it owns product latency.

## Task 5 - Final Benchmarks, Reports, And Roadmap Closeout

**Files:**

- Modify: `docs/reports/yune-vs-librime-performance.md`
- Modify: `docs/reports/yune-vs-librime-root-cause-analysis.md`
- Modify: `docs/roadmap.md`
- Modify: `docs/requirements.md`
- Move on closeout: `docs/plans/active/m37-plan-engine-hyper-optimization.md` to `docs/plans/completed/m37-plan-engine-hyper-optimization.md`
- Create: `docs/reports/evidence/m37-engine-hyper-optimization/final/`
- Create: `docs/reports/evidence/m37-engine-hyper-optimization/final-gates.md`

- [ ] **Step 5.1: Run final native evidence**

Run:

```powershell
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p yune-core --test upstream_luna_pinyin_parity
cargo test -p yune-core --test cantonese_parity
cargo test -p yune-rime-api --test typeduck_web
cargo test --workspace
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\benchmark-native-rime-inprocess.ps1 -OutputRoot docs\reports\evidence\m37-engine-hyper-optimization\final -Iterations 5 -SessionIterations 20 -KeyIterations 20 -DeployProductBeforeBenchmark
git diff --check
```

Expected:

- All gates pass or any missing external/browser gate is explicitly justified.
- Final evidence includes rsmarisa status, native mmap-mode status, materialization counters, Track A comparison rows, Track B before/after rows, memory rows, and `hai` attribution before/after.

- [ ] **Step 5.2: Run runtime/browser gates if runtime-visible files changed**

If M37 changes the WASM/runtime-visible engine path, rebuild the TypeDuck-Web WASM assets and run focused real-browser evidence before any browser claim.

Expected:

- Native engine wins remain native-only unless this evidence exists.
- M31 public-demo delivery/cache claims remain separate.

- [ ] **Step 5.3: Update public reports**

Update the performance and root-cause reports with:

- exact `rsmarisa` outcome, native mmap-mode evidence, and active path evidence
- exact candidate materialization before/after counters
- Track B `hai` before/after movement
- Track B product row before/after medians and working set
- Track A final ratios versus librime
- native versus browser caveats
- any full-list-only eager fallback that remains by design

Expected:

- No "faster than librime" claim unless Track A fair evidence proves it.
- No browser startup/typing claim unless browser evidence exists.

- [ ] **Step 5.4: Close the milestone honestly**

M37 may close only when:

- `rsmarisa` is active on the real product compiled-table path
- native product rows prove mmap-mode marisa loading, or M37 remains open for a patch/fork/adapter
- product key rows no longer take the old full-list materialization/context clone path for page reads
- `hai` is explained and materially moved
- final evidence and reports are checked in
- roadmap and requirements statuses match reality

If any hard gate is still open, keep the plan active and continue with the next measured owner. Do not archive M37 as "closed by no-go" for `rsmarisa`, native mmap, or candidate materialization.

## Execution Handoff

Start from current `origin/main`. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/conventions.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/requirements.md`, this plan, `docs/reports/yune-vs-librime-performance.md`, `docs/reports/yune-vs-librime-root-cause-analysis.md`, and the M36 evidence directory before editing. Keep M31 delivery/UI/Cloudflare work in its own lane. M37 owns engine storage and candidate materialization; if an M31 session touches engine/schema-install/runtime storage paths, serialize or move one track to a separate worktree. Stage only M37 files and preserve unrelated worktree changes.
