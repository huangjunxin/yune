# M21 — TypeDuck-Web Product Behavioral Comparison Protocol

> **Status:** Finished / archived (hard-oracle gap ledger fully dispositioned; future live-product spot checks are optional feel-target work) · **Milestone:** M21 (TypeDuck-Web product comparison) · **Closed:** 2026-06-20 · **Type:** comparison protocol / closeout reference · **Depends on:** M20 (merged) · **Critical path:** no (qualitative real-world sanity check that feeds the backlog)

> **For agentic workers:** This is **not** an engine milestone and produces **no fixes by itself** — it produces a _divergence gap ledger_. It compares Yune's internal harness against the real deployed product as a _behavior/feel_ target, **not a hard oracle**. The hard oracle remains the captured TypeDuck `v1.1.2` fixtures. Run this **after M20 merges** (M20 gives the harness the toggles needed to match the product's settings).

**Goal:** Systematically compare the **core IME behavior** (candidate set, ranking, auto-composition, fuzzy/容錯, simplification, reverse-lookup, paging) of:

- **Yune harness** — `apps/yune-web/` driven by the Yune engine (the internal playground M20 builds), and
- **the real product** — `https://github.com/TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Web`, deployed at `https://www.typeduck.hk/web/`,

so we know **which differences are real engine gaps, which are expected-by-design, and which are pending M17–M19** — without chasing noise.

> **Surface reminder** (see `docs/conventions.md` → "Web surface terminology"): `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/` is the runtime bridge; `apps/yune-web/` is the internal harness compared _here_; the deployed `typeduck.hk/web` is the real product. These are three different things.

## Current status

M21 is complete as a hard-oracle closeout. The product-comparison ledger has no remaining hard-oracle action rows: live product observations are recorded only as a moving feel target, while every should-match row is either fixed against or matched to a pinned TypeDuck v1.1.2 fixture.

- **M21-GAP-01:** dictionary sentence-composition divergence, fixed against the `v1.1.2` fixture.
- **M21-GAP-02:** `nri` prefix fallback plus `jyut6ping3` prediction-count behavior, fixed against `v1.1.2` fixtures and browser evidence.
- **M21 closeout fixture:** `jyut6ping3-m21-closeout.json` locks the remaining `nei`, `ngo`, `m`, `mgoi`, `ngohaigo`, `hou`, `neivv`, and `hk2s` dispositions, including the final standalone-`m` and `mgoi` abbreviation/fuzzy fixes.

Keep this archived protocol as the reference for any future optional live-product spot check. Such checks must still classify differences against a new pinned oracle fixture before changing engine behavior.

## Why the deployed product is a target, not an oracle

The deployed product runs the **actual TypeDuck fork engine** in a browser, so it is a genuine real-world reference. But it is a **moving, less-controlled target**, not a reproducible oracle:

- The hard, reproducible, non-circular oracle stays the captured **`v1.1.2` fixtures** under `crates/yune-core/tests/fixtures/typeduck-v1.1.2/`.
- **If this comparison finds a real divergence in a should-match behavior, the fix path is: capture it as a `v1.1.2` oracle golden and fix against that** — never chase the live site directly.

## Section 0 — Confounder controls (do this FIRST; it is most of the value)

A naive "diff the two apps" drowns in apples-to-oranges noise. Pin these before recording anything; if a confounder cannot be pinned, **downgrade to qualitative spot-check and do not report ranking diffs as bugs.**

1. **Engine + dictionary version skew.** The deployed product may run a **newer** engine/dict than our pinned `v1.1.2`. Establish and stamp the deployed version (build info / about page / asset hashes if observable). Treat version-skew differences as _expected_, not Yune bugs.
2. **Fresh userdb / learning state.** Both engines learn. Compare with cleared learning on both: a private/incognito window + cleared IndexedDB/site data on the product; a fresh userdb in the harness. Otherwise ranking diverges from learning history, not engine logic.
3. **Same schema + dict.** Confirm both use `jyut6ping3` (mobile) with a comparable dictionary; note any entry/weight delta. Different dicts ⇒ different candidate sets/ranking for non-engine reasons.
4. **Matched settings.** Align toggles using the M20 controls: completion, correction, `combine_candidates`, simplification, `prediction_never_first`, prediction threshold, page size. Record the exact settings on both sides.

## Section 1 — Input corpus

Run the **same typed inputs** in both apps (reuse the M20 guided scenarios + ledger cases):

| Input | Targets |
| --- | --- |
| `nei` | baseline candidate list |
| `ngo` | classic top candidate / prediction-never-first |
| `santai` | long-entry prediction (`身體` + `身體健康`) |
| `sigin` | code-path prediction (`市建局` without a `市建` word) |
| `m`, `mgoi` | standalone-`m` + fuzzy/容錯 (`ng→m`) |
| `ngohaigo` | auto-composition / sentence (`我係個`) |
| `loengnincin`, `leoicijyu` | cross-boundary dictionary-phrase composition (`兩年前`; live-site observation expected `類似於`, but the hard `v1.1.2` oracle composes `類似如`) — the M21-GAP-01 investigation; verify each input's jyutping against the dict first |
| `hou` | homograph grouping vs separate (`combine_candidates`) |
| tone-letters (`neivv`…) | `letter_to_tone` preedit; avoid `seov` because v1.1.2 still has the `eo`/`oe` lazy-sound fuzzy rule while the moving live product appears to have refined or dropped it |
| a 1-edit typo | correction (on/off) |
| an `hk2s` case | simplification toggle |
| a reverse-lookup case | dictionary-panel pronunciations |
| a multi-page input | paging behavior |

## Section 2 — Comparable outputs (record per input)

Top-N candidate text · candidate order / highlighted index · candidate comments / Jyutping · long-entry predictions · auto-composed sentence rows · paging behavior · commit result · visible state labels (e.g. `全形`/`半形`).

## Section 3 — Divergence classification key (the heart of the protocol)

Label every difference. This is the fork-parity ledger applied to a live diff:

| Label | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `matches` | Same observable behavior | none |
| `expected-by-design` | F08 prediction **ranking order** (we track upstream-1.17.0 ranking + knobs, **not** fork byte-parity); composition word-penalty / `matching_code_size` preedit (`do-not-preserve`); F09 display-language columns (UI-side) | none — **do not log as a bug** |
| `pending-M17-M19` | Differences that depend on the **statistical LM lattice** (poet/octagram not implemented). **Not** dictionary-phrase composition (e.g. `我係個`, `兩年前`), which is M15 should-match — route that to `unexpected-composition-gap`. | defer; note only |
| `product-only-UI` | Layout/UX of the shipping product, not engine behavior | out of scope here |
| `unexpected-candidate-gap` | Missing/extra candidates in the **core set** | **investigate** |
| `unexpected-composition-gap` | Auto-composition (incl. **dictionary-phrase sentence composition** like `兩年前`/`類似於`) / fuzzy / simplification / reverse-lookup pronunciation differs | **investigate** |
| `unexpected-ranking-gap` | Ranking differs in a **non-prediction** path that should match | **investigate** |
| `needs-engine-investigation` | Unclear; capture and triage | triage |

**Should-match (ledger `preserve✓`) behaviors** — a divergence here is real signal: core candidate set, fuzzy/容錯, auto-composition fallback, `combine_candidates`/separate, `hk2s` simplification, reverse-lookup pronunciations, `letter_to_tone`, `show_full_code`. **Expected-to-diverge** — broad prediction ranking order (F08) beyond the M21-GAP-02 `jyut6ping3` prediction-count fixture, composition penalty / `matching_code_size` (do-not-preserve), LM sentence lattice (M17), display columns (F09), all UI.

> **Dictionary-phrase composition is should-match; only its _ranking_ may diverge.** Producing the composed sentence _at all_ (e.g. `兩年前` from `兩年`+`前`) is M15 dictionary-driven behavior and a `preserve✓` should-match target — it is **not** the deferred M17 poet/octagram LM. The `do-not-preserve` part (ledger note 5) is only the fork's _word-penalty / fewer-syllables preference among valid composed sentences_. So the decision rule is: **no composed sentence where the oracle has one = correctness gap (`unexpected-composition-gap`, investigate); composed sentence present but ranked differently = expected-by-design.** This is exactly what M21-GAP-01 below must resolve.

## Section 4 — Evidence capture

- **Deployed product:** **manual / one-time capture only.** Do **not** build an automated Playwright scraper against `typeduck.hk` (third-party site: fragile DOM, ToS). Capture screenshots + transcribed candidate lists + JSON notes; stamp: browser, date, deployed URL, observed engine/dict version, settings, fresh-userdb confirmation.
- **Yune harness:** the M20 playground via Playwright or manual; stamp: Yune commit, M20 branch/commit, schema/config state, settings.
- Store under `apps/yune-web/e2e/results/m21-product-comparison/` with a dated reference snapshot.

**Settings profile snapshot (record per run, both sides).** Capture the exact control states up front so any divergence is attributable to a setting, not an unrecorded difference (this operationalizes the Section 0 "matched settings" confounder):

| Setting | Yune harness (M20 control) | Deployed product |
| --- | --- | --- |
| completion (`enable_completion`) |  |  |
| correction (`enable_correction`) |  |  |
| auto-composition (`enable_sentence`) |  |  |
| input memory (`enable_user_dict`) |  |  |
| combine vs separate (`combine_candidates`) |  |  |
| prediction never-first |  |  |
| prediction threshold |  |  |
| simplification (`hk2s`) |  |  |
| full-shape / ASCII mode |  |  |
| userdb state (fresh / accumulated) |  |  |
| engine + dict version | Yune commit | observed product version |

## Section 5 — Output: the gap ledger

Produce a table, **not immediate fixes**:

| Input | Product output | Yune output | Label | Disposition |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------- | ----- | ----------- |

Disposition ∈ { real bug → capture a `v1.1.2` golden + fix against it · `pending-M17-M19` · `expected-by-design` · `product-UX` · `out-of-scope` }. Real "should-match" divergences feed the improvement backlog as oracle-golden work; everything else is recorded so it is not re-investigated.

## Section 5b — M21-GAP-01: multi-syllable dictionary-composition divergence (fixed)

> **Status:** classified and fixed on 2026-06-20 · `unexpected-composition-gap` confirmed by `v1.1.2` oracle capture. Evidence: `crates/yune-core/tests/fixtures/typeduck-v1.1.2/jyut6ping3-m21-sentence-composition.json` and `apps/yune-web/e2e/results/m21-product-comparison/2026-06-20T0748Z-m21-gap-01-sentence-composition/`.

**Observation (manual, harness).** Toneless multi-syllable inputs whose target is a _dictionary-phrase_ sentence return a chaotic candidate list instead of the composed sentence, while `typeduck.hk/web` composes them:

- `loengnincin` → product expectation and `v1.1.2` oracle: `兩年前`
- `leoicijyu` → live-site/product expectation was `類似於`, but the hard `v1.1.2` oracle composes `類似如`; Yune follows the oracle fixture.

**Why this is not obviously expected.** It is _dictionary-phrase composition (M15 scope), not the M17 poet/octagram LM_, and it is **asymmetric**: the same-shaped `ngohaigo` → `我係個` (a 2-syllable phrase + 1 syllable) composes **top-1 on a fresh userdb** in the M21 snapshot (`run-manifest.json` fresh context). So a flat/chaotic result for `loengnincin`/`leoicijyu` is a real anomaly, not merely the `do-not-preserve` word-penalty ranking. Mechanically, Yune has no librime syllable-graph speller; `sentence_candidate()` ([`translator/mod.rs`](../../../crates/yune-core/src/translator/mod.rs)) is a fallback-only Viterbi gated on `candidates.is_empty()` over toneless-aliased substring probes — but note the obvious "zero matches / no tone-stripping" theory is **false** (the schema's `derive/\d//` adds toneless aliases and `ngohaigo` composes), so the cause must be found empirically, not assumed.

**Oracle-first investigation result:**

- Corpus verified against the production `jyut6ping3.dict.yaml`: `loengnincin`, `leoicijyu`, `ngohaigo`, `loengjathau`, `geijatcin`, and `gamjatheoi`.
- Pre-fix Yune source-aware evidence showed the fallback gate **did fire** and produced a `sentence` row at index 0, but the sentence text was wrong for five of six cases: `loengnincin` → `𦧲五官前次我`, `leoicijyu` → `呢在次如中`, `loengjathau` → `兩一後`, `geijatcin` → `機一次我`, and `gamjatheoi` → `今一靴時`. `ngohaigo` already matched.
- The `v1.1.2` oracle composed all six cases at top-1: `兩年前`, `類似如`, `我係個`, `兩日後`, `機日前`, `今日去`.
- Classification: `unexpected-composition-gap`. The problem was sentence path scoring: raw frequency exponentials let high-frequency short pieces dominate dictionary phrase compositions. The fix changes sentence path scoring to log-space with an oracle-backed word penalty, preserving fallback-only gating and adding the TypeDuck-style synthetic `composition` lookup row for composed sentence comments.
- The word penalty is a Yune heuristic, effectively "prefer fewer pieces, then use frequency as a tiebreak", validated on these six fixture cases rather than an oracle-exported quantity. Harder composition tradeoffs that need true phrase probabilities remain M17 poet/LM territory, and this composition corpus should be expanded opportunistically as new real product cases appear.
- Post-fix source-aware evidence shows all six Yune top sentence rows match the oracle top text, with `fallback_gate=fired_returned_sentence`.

**Protocol retained for future M21 gaps:**

1. **Reproduce at a pinned Yune commit.** Run `loengnincin`, `leoicijyu`, `ngohaigo` (working control), and 2–3 more analogous two-word cross-boundary inputs through the real harness on the production `jyut6ping3.dict.yaml`; capture the **actual** full ranked candidate JSON (top-N text, codes, preedit, and whether/where the `☯` sentence row appears) — not a screenshot. Investigate _why_ a flat multi-candidate list appears when `sentence_candidate()` returns a single path (check whether the visible rows come from completion/correction/userdb rather than the sentence path, and whether the `translator/mod.rs` `candidates.is_empty()` fallback gate is even firing).
2. **Capture `v1.1.2` oracle goldens for the same inputs** under `jyut6ping3_mobile` against the production dict via `scripts/capture-typeduck-jyutping.ps1` + `oracle-rime-probe.cs`. Store a provenance-stamped locked fixture (e.g. `jyut6ping3-m21-sentence-composition.json`) beside `jyut6ping3-m14-options.json`. Non-circular: expected bytes come from the oracle binary, never from Yune or the live site.
3. **Classify per Section 3.** Oracle composes the sentence **and** Yune produces none / only chaos → `unexpected-composition-gap` (correctness regression that reopens fork-parity-ledger note 5). Oracle composes it and Yune produces it but ranks lower → already-decided `do-not-preserve`; record as expected, do **not** fix.
4. **Conditional fix — only if step 3 proves a correctness regression.** Minimal change in `sentence_candidate()` / the fallback gate, plus a regression test asserting against the captured `v1.1.2` golden. Then update the ledger note-5 row and add a tracked engine work item. No ABI / `RimeCandidate` change; AI stays default-off.

## Section 5c — M21-GAP-02: prefix fallback and prediction-count divergence (fixed)

> **Status:** classified and fixed on 2026-06-20 · `unexpected-candidate-gap` / narrowed `unexpected-ranking-gap`, confirmed by `v1.1.2` oracle fixtures.

**Item A — `nri` prefix fallback.** Existing M14 correction fixtures already proved the hard oracle behavior: with correction off, `nri` falls back to the longest valid leading segment `n`, surfaces rows `我`, `你`, `外`, `能`, `內`, `呢`, and previews `我ri`; with correction on, `你` is first and commits as `你`. Yune now applies that partial-parse prefix fallback for the TypeDuck `jyut6ping3` profile, and the M20 browser evidence was regenerated as a real correction off/on before/after rather than a browser-surface N/A.

**Item B — prediction count / single-character crowding.** New fixture `jyut6ping3-m21-prediction-ranking.json` locks TypeDuck v1.1.2 behavior for `santai`, `sigin`, `gwongdung`, and `hoenggong`: one long prediction is kept near the front, while single-character matches remain on page 1. Yune now adopts that prediction-count limit for the `jyut6ping3` profile only. This narrows fork-parity-ledger note 4 without reopening broad fork ranking byte parity.

**Item C — `seov` version skew.** The v1.1.2 schema still contains the `eo`/`oe` lazy-sound fuzzy rule in `include.yaml` (`derive/eo/oe/ # 容錯 eo/oe 不分`), so Yune is correct to apply it. The deployed product appears to have refined or dropped that rule. Treat `seov` as expected version skew and use a non-`eo`/`oe` input such as `neivv` for future letter-to-tone product captures.

## Section 5d — M21 closeout fixture and final ledger (complete)

> **Status:** classified and fixed on 2026-06-20 · remaining rows locked by `crates/yune-core/tests/fixtures/typeduck-v1.1.2/jyut6ping3-m21-closeout.json` and recorded in `apps/yune-web/e2e/results/m21-product-comparison/2026-06-20T0849Z-yune-cdb7bd52-product-manual/gap-ledger.md`.

The closeout fixture captures the remaining product-comparison rows against the hard v1.1.2 oracle: baseline `nei`/`ngo`, standalone `m`, `mgoi`, `ngohaigo`, `hou`, tone-letter `neivv`, and `ngohaigo` with `hk2s` simplification enabled. The final ledger contains no product-capture-pending rows: each row is now one of `match`, `oracle-backed-fixed`, `expected-by-design`, or `browser-surface-N/A`.

Two additional implementation gaps were fixed during closeout:

- Standalone `m` now preserves normal `ng→m` fuzzy rows ahead of generated one-letter abbreviation rows, matching the v1.1.2 top order.
- `mgoi` now matches the v1.1.2 two-syllable `m` abbreviation/fuzzy family: `唔該`, `唔該晒`, `唔過`, `五個`, `每個`.

The deployed product remains useful as a future feel target, but M21 no longer has an open hard-oracle action item.

## Guardrails

- **Complements, does not replace,** the `v1.1.2` fixture parity (which stays the reproducible gold standard).
- The deployed site is a **moving target** — re-stamp its version every run; a diff may be version skew, not a Yune bug.
- **Do not chase** broad F08 prediction-ranking or M17–M19 LM gaps as bugs — they are expected, except where a locked `v1.1.2` fixture such as M21-GAP-02 proves a TypeDuck-profile prediction-count rule.
- **No automated scraping** of the deployed product.
- **Off the parity critical path** — timebox it; it is a sanity check + backlog feeder, not a gate.

## When to run

After **M20 merges** (the harness needs the controls to match the product's settings). The output gap ledger informs the M17–M19 priority discussion and any new `v1.1.2` golden captures.
