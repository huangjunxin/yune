# M25 TypeDuck-Web Dogfooding Round 2 Implementation Plan

> **Status:** Intake - **Milestone:** M25 (TypeDuck-Web dogfooding round 2) - **Created:** 2026-06-21 - **Type:** active issue ledger / future execution plan
>
> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.
>
> **Intake note:** This plan starts the second manual dogfooding loop for the internal TypeDuck-Web playground. Add the user's upcoming feedback as `M25-DOGFOOD-*` rows here before implementing fixes.

**Goal:** Capture, classify, and later execute the second real dogfooding feedback batch for the internal TypeDuck-Web playground without reopening completed M24 rows or weakening oracle-backed compatibility claims.

**Architecture:** M25 treats `third_party/typeduck-web/` as the browser dogfooding surface and keeps the browser app on Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + small local components. Browser and UI defects are fixed with Playwright evidence from the local `/web/` app; engine-output or ranking defects require pinned TypeDuck `v1.1.2` or upstream `1.17.0` fixtures before changing engine behavior. TypeDuck-Web source edits must be regenerated into the tracked patch before they count as landed.

**Tech Stack:** TypeDuck-Web React/TypeScript, Vite/Bun, Tailwind CSS, small local React components, Playwright, `@yune-ime/typeduck-runtime`, `yune-rime-api` C ABI, `yune-core`, TypeDuck `v1.1.2` oracle fixtures, upstream librime `1.17.0` oracle fixtures.

---

## Scope

M25 is the second dogfooding and hardening loop for the internal browser playground:

- **In scope:** manual play feedback from `http://localhost:5173/web/`, first-run and reload behavior, schema switching, settings ergonomics, candidate panel layout, dictionary/detail panel readability, input scenarios, inspector/status usefulness, and local dogfood UI polish.
- **In scope with oracle evidence:** any change to candidate text, candidate set, candidate order, segmentation, correction, prediction, reverse lookup, dictionary lookup payloads, or commit behavior.
- **In scope for frontend stack maintenance:** keep the dogfood demo on Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + small local components only. Do not add DaisyUI back and do not add another UI framework.
- **Out of scope:** editing the separately cloned or deployed `TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Web` product, treating `typeduck.hk/web` as the hard oracle, broad design-system work, widening the default `RimeApi`, or adding unsupported controls that only appear to work.

## Relationship To M24

M24 is closed and archived at `docs/plans/archive/m24-plan-typeduck-web-dogfooding.md`. Do not edit M24 rows for new feedback.

Use M24 as the baseline for:

- local Tailwind-only component stack,
- `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m24-dogfooding/` as historical evidence only,
- TypeDuck-Web patch discipline,
- the `jigaajiusihaa` TypeDuck `v1.1.2` ordering fixture,
- the `menu/page_size` customize key,
- the Jyutping Mandarin-pinyin affix path `` `p... ``.

M25 evidence belongs under `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/<issue-id>/`.

## Classification Rules

Classify every report before editing code:

| Classification | Use when | First evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Browser integration | Worker/runtime/assets/settings wiring fails or drifts from the intended browser contract. | Browser console logs, worker diagnostics, state JSON, screenshot. |
| UI polish | The rendered app is confusing, cramped, mislabeled, inaccessible, or inefficient, but engine output is correct. | Screenshot plus the exact interaction path. |
| Engine correctness | Candidate output, ranking, commit text, segmentation, correction, prediction, or reverse lookup seems wrong. | Pinned oracle fixture or a row marked blocked until fixture capture. |
| Unsupported / N/A | The report asks for behavior intentionally not exposed in the dogfood playground. | Short rationale and, if useful, a UI copy/docs change. |
| Future product integration | The report belongs to the real TypeDuck-Web product, not the internal Yune harness. | Product-track note; do not edit `third_party/typeduck-web/source/` unless the harness also needs it. |
| Needs triage | The symptom is not reproducible or does not yet identify the layer. | Screenshot/state capture and a narrow reproduction attempt. |

## Evidence Rules

- Save browser evidence under `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/<issue-id>/`.
- For every browser-visible fix, capture a screenshot or JSON/state snapshot from the real local `/web/` app.
- For every engine-output fix, add or extend a pinned oracle fixture before implementation.
- Do not use `https://www.typeduck.hk/web/` as a hard oracle. It is a useful feel target only.
- Keep completed M9/M13/M16/M20/M22/M24 gates green unless a row explicitly changes a supported contract with fresh evidence.

## Patch-Layer Rule

`third_party/typeduck-web/source/` is gitignored in the Yune repository. Local edits there are allowed for development, but a M25 row is not closed until the matching tracked artifacts are updated.

Before closing any row that changes TypeDuck-Web source:

1. Regenerate `third_party/typeduck-web/patches/yune-typeduck-runtime.patch` from the patched upstream checkout.
2. Reverse-check from `third_party/typeduck-web/source/`:

   ```powershell
   git apply --reverse --check ..\patches\yune-typeduck-runtime.patch
   ```

3. Forward-check the patch on a clean source checkout reset to `third_party/typeduck-web/typeduck-web.lock.json`.
4. Stage only the tracked artifacts for the slice: the patch, Yune-owned integration files, Playwright tests/evidence, Rust/runtime files, docs, and lock metadata when the upstream source pin changes.

## Running Issue Ledger

M25 intake began on 2026-06-21 with user-reported browser dogfooding regressions. Keep adding one row per distinct user-visible symptom using the next `M25-DOGFOOD-XX` id.

| ID | Status | Classification | User-visible issue | First repro / evidence | Owning surfaces to inspect first | Close criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M25-DOGFOOD-01 | Open | Browser integration / performance | Refreshing `http://localhost:5173/web/` still leaves `載入中 Loading...` visible for too long; the user sees no practical improvement compared with the pre-M24 app and considers this unacceptable for real users. | Reproduced in the in-app browser on 2026-06-21: reload took `47.752s`; startup marker reported `totalMs=47331`, with `runtime:initialized` consuming nearly the entire delay after assets loaded. Evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-01/reload-startup-repro.json`. | `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/worker.ts`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/yune-integration/adapter.ts`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/yune-integration/assets.ts`, `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/src/typeduck.ts`, `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/src/module.ts`, `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/src/filesystem.ts`, `crates/yune-rime-api/src/typeduck_web.rs`, schema deploy/init paths under `crates/yune-rime-api/src/`. | Close only after a measured startup optimization lands. Add a Playwright startup budget test that records phase timings, preserve `startup:complete` diagnostics, and capture before/after evidence under this issue id. Target: interactive shell visible quickly and warm reload IME readiness materially below the current ~47s baseline; any chosen budget must be written into the test and justified by local evidence. |
| M25-DOGFOOD-02 | Open | Browser integration / settings and candidate pagination | The page-size control is hard to find after M24 UI changes, its allowed range is wrong for the requested behavior, and changing it still does not cap the rendered candidate list. The user expects a visible slider/control allowing 3-10 candidates, where setting 9 shows exactly 9 visible candidates. | User screenshot showed `hai` rendering far more than 10 rows. Reproduced in the in-app browser on 2026-06-21: DOM had page-size slider `min=4`, `max=10`, `value=6`, but typing `hai` rendered `50` visible candidate rows. Evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-02/page-size-hai-repro.json`. | `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Preferences.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Inputs.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/CandidatePanel.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/App.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/yune-integration/adapter.ts`, `crates/yune-rime-api/src/typeduck_web.rs`, `crates/yune-rime-api/src/context_api.rs`, `crates/yune-rime-api/tests/typeduck_web.rs`, `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/yune-typeduck.spec.ts`. | Close when the UI exposes an obvious 3-10 page-size control and the rendered candidate panel never exceeds the configured page size. Add/extend native `typeduck_web` coverage for `menu/page_size` at 3 and 9, add Playwright coverage that sets 3/9/10 and types `hai`, verify page navigation still works, regenerate and reverse/forward check `third_party/typeduck-web/patches/yune-typeduck-runtime.patch`, and capture browser JSON/screenshot evidence under this issue id. |
| M25-DOGFOOD-03 | Open | Browser integration / typing responsiveness | Typing in the textbox can still show the global `è¼‰å…¥ä¸­ Loading...` state and can stall for about a second when entering a character. This makes the dogfood IME feel blocked even after the page becomes visible. | User-reported during manual dogfooding on 2026-06-21. Evidence placeholder with exact report: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-03/typing-latency-user-report.json`. Needs measured browser repro with keydown-to-candidate timing. | `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/CandidatePanel.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/rime.ts`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/worker.ts`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/App.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Toolbar.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/yune-integration/adapter.ts`, `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/src/typeduck.ts`, `crates/yune-rime-api/src/typeduck_web.rs`, `crates/yune-core/src/engine.rs`. | Close only after per-key latency is measured and improved. Add Playwright instrumentation for keydown-to-candidate update latency on `hai`, `nei`, and a long phrase; split queue wait, worker roundtrip, Rust `process_key`, and React render time; remove global loading from normal per-key composition; ensure typing remains responsive while startup/deploy/customize is in flight; save before/after latency JSON under this issue id. |
| M25-DOGFOOD-04 | Open | UI polish / schema switcher layout | The schema list sits in its own vertical block below the three mode buttons, wasting vertical space. The user wants the schema list moved into the same top row as the three buttons. The `luna_pinyin` option is also currently shown as `普通話`, but the user expects the schema name `朙月拼音`. | User-reported during manual dogfooding on 2026-06-21. Local verification found upstream `1.17.0` `luna_pinyin.schema.yaml` uses `朙月拼音`, while the current TypeDuck-Web source and TypeDuck v1.1.2 captured schema use `普通話`. Evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-04/schema-switcher-toolbar-and-luna-name-report.json`. | `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/App.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Toolbar.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/SchemaSwitcher.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/consts.ts`, `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Inputs.tsx`, `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/yune-typeduck.spec.ts`. | Close when the schema selector is part of the top control row with the three mode buttons on desktop, wraps within the same compact control band on narrow screens, and `luna_pinyin` is labeled `朙月拼音` as the primary user-facing schema name unless the row is explicitly revised with TypeDuck-v1.1.2-specific rationale. Add Playwright evidence covering desktop and mobile layout, active schema switching, and the visible Luna label; regenerate and reverse/forward check `third_party/typeduck-web/patches/yune-typeduck-runtime.patch` if source changed. |

## Accepted Review Corrections

- `M25-DOGFOOD-01` startup work must address the two validated P0 suspects before broader micro-optimization: the browser WASM artifact is currently built from `target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/debug`, and the TypeDuck-Web adapter forces deploy freshness by calling `invalidateDeployedSchema(...)` before `currentRuntime.deploy()`. The review evidence is tracked at `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-01/claude-review-p0-notes.json`.
- Do not treat fast asset fetches as proof that startup is network-bound. The current reproduction showed assets loading in under 100 ms while `runtime:initialized` consumed about 47 seconds, so Task 2 must re-measure release WASM and deploy reuse before setting the final warm-reload budget.

## Intake Task

### Task 1: Convert User Feedback Into M25 Rows

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/plans/m25-plan-typeduck-web-dogfooding-round-2.md`
- Create evidence as needed: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/<issue-id>/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Split the feedback into distinct symptoms**

  Treat each independently reproducible behavior as one row. If two comments share one root cause but have different user-visible symptoms, keep separate rows until triage proves they should close together.

- [ ] **Step 2: Assign stable ids**

  Use `M25-DOGFOOD-01`, `M25-DOGFOOD-02`, and so on. Do not renumber rows after they are referenced by evidence, commits, or tests.

- [ ] **Step 3: Classify each row before implementation**

  Use one of the classifications in this plan. Mark ambiguous reports as `Needs triage`; do not force them into browser or engine buckets prematurely.

- [ ] **Step 4: Name the first evidence path**

  For browser reports, record the intended evidence directory, for example:

  ```text
  third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-01/
  ```

  For engine reports, record the fixture family first: `typeduck-v1.1.2` for TypeDuck profile behavior or `upstream-1.17.0` for default upstream behavior.

- [ ] **Step 5: Name the owning surfaces**

  List the files or test families to inspect first. For TypeDuck-Web source changes, include the `source/` file and the tracked patch requirement.

- [ ] **Step 6: Write close criteria that can be verified**

  Each row needs concrete close criteria: owning test, evidence path, patch regeneration if applicable, and the focused gate to run.

### Task 2: M25-DOGFOOD-01 Startup Performance Optimization

**Files:**
- Modify: `Cargo.toml`
- Modify: `scripts/typeduck-wasm-build.sh`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/worker.ts`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/yune-integration/adapter.ts`
- Modify if profiling still points there: `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/src/typeduck.ts`
- Modify if profiling still points there: `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/src/filesystem.ts`
- Modify if profiling still points there: `crates/yune-rime-api/src/typeduck_web.rs`
- Test: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/yune-typeduck.spec.ts`
- Evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-01/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Preserve the failing startup characterization and artifact facts**

  Keep the current reload evidence as the baseline, then add a Playwright startup budget characterization that reloads `/web/`, waits for `document.documentElement.dataset.yuneLoading === "false"`, captures the latest `startup:complete` diagnostic, and writes `m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-01/startup-before.json`. Also record the shipped `.wasm` size, whether the build came from `debug` or `release`, and whether Emscripten/wasm optimization flags were applied. The first test may fail against the current ~47s local baseline, but the final budget should be chosen after the P0 fixes below are measured.

- [ ] **Step 2: Ship release-mode browser WASM first**

  Update the TypeDuck-Web build path so the browser artifact is not copied from `target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/debug`. Add conservative release tuning in `Cargo.toml` for the existing workspace (`opt-level = 3`, `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, and `strip = true` if supported by the active toolchain), update `scripts/typeduck-wasm-build.sh` to build `typeduck_web_module` with `--release`, copy from `target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/release`, and add Emscripten optimization flags such as `-O3` or `-Oz` to the link path. Run `wasm-opt -O3` only when available and record whether it was skipped. Preserve the existing JS glue contract: `createYuneTypeduckModule`, `cwrap`, `UTF8ToString`, `FS`, and `IDBFS` must still exist after the build.

- [ ] **Step 3: Stop rebuilding/deploying fresh state on every reload**

  Remove or guard the unconditional `invalidateDeployedSchema(currentFs, currentPrepareOptions)` call before `currentRuntime.deploy()`. Do not simply delete the safety check; replace it with freshness validation based on `assetVersion`, schema/resource checksums, or another deterministic deploy stamp. Persist and reuse `/rime/build` through IDBFS when fresh. If `jyut6ping3_mobile` still spends startup time generating stable table/reverse artifacts, ship or prefer precompiled artifacts only after adding fixture-backed evidence that the resulting candidates and paging behavior remain unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 4: Re-measure after the P0 fixes before choosing deeper work**

  Rebuild the patchable TypeDuck-Web source, reload `/web/`, and save `startup-after-release-wasm.json` and `startup-after-deploy-reuse.json` as applicable. Compare `startup:complete.totalMs`, the user-visible loading duration, `.wasm` size, and deploy/cache diagnostics against `reload-startup-repro.json`. The final warm-reload budget must be written from this measured optimized baseline, not guessed from the pre-fix 47s number.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add finer `runtime:initialized` phase markers only if needed**

  If release WASM plus deploy reuse do not meet the startup budget, split `runtime:initialized` into nested markers around `TypeDuckRuntime.init`, filesystem mount/sync, schema deploy, default schema selection, dictionary/table loading, and persistence sync. The next evidence file must show which sub-phase owns the remaining delay.

- [ ] **Step 6: Keep startup latency separate from typing latency**

  Startup optimization must not hide the separate typing-stutter problem. If typing is still blocked while startup continues, keep `M25-DOGFOOD-03` open and measure it separately instead of claiming startup fixed the perceived performance problem.

- [ ] **Step 7: Prove the improvement and regenerate the TypeDuck-Web patch if source changed**

  Re-run the startup test, save the final `startup-after.json`, and compare `startup:complete.totalMs` plus the visible loading duration against the baseline evidence. The final row update must state before/after timings, the release/deploy evidence paths, and any remaining bottleneck. If any file under `third_party/typeduck-web/source/` changed, regenerate `third_party/typeduck-web/patches/yune-typeduck-runtime.patch`, reverse-check it from `source/`, and forward-check it on a clean source checkout.

### Task 3: M25-DOGFOOD-02 Page-Size Slider And Candidate Cap

**Files:**
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Preferences.tsx`
- Modify if needed: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Inputs.tsx`
- Modify if needed: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/CandidatePanel.tsx`
- Modify if needed: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/yune-integration/adapter.ts`
- Modify if needed: `crates/yune-rime-api/src/typeduck_web.rs`
- Test: `crates/yune-rime-api/tests/typeduck_web.rs`
- Test: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/yune-typeduck.spec.ts`
- Evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-02/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing native page-size coverage for 3 and 9**

  Extend `typeduck_adapter_real_assets_page_size_customize_limits_context_page` or add a focused companion test that customizes `menu/page_size` to `3` and `9`, types a high-candidate input such as `hai`, and asserts `context.page_size` and `context.candidates.len()` match the requested cap.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add failing browser coverage for the visible control**

  Add a Playwright test that locates the page-size control by its Cantonese/English label, asserts the range is `3` through `10`, sets it to `9`, types `hai`, and asserts exactly 9 visible candidate rows. Repeat with `3` to protect the lower bound.

- [ ] **Step 3: Fix discoverability and the allowed range**

  Keep the control in the settings UI, but make it visibly discoverable in the candidate/display area and set its range to `3..10`. The visible value must update immediately when the slider changes.

- [ ] **Step 4: Fix the runtime cap**

  Trace the browser response after `Rime.customize({ pageSize })`. If native `typeduck_web` returns a paged `context.candidates` array but the browser renders all candidates, fix `CandidatePanel` or the adapter mapping. If native returns too many candidates for `menu/page_size`, fix `typeduck_web.rs` or `context_api.rs`. Do not hide extra rows with CSS while leaving selection/page navigation semantics wrong.

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove paging and selection still work**

  The browser test must verify first-page row count, next/previous page behavior, and digit selection after the cap is applied. Save JSON and screenshots under `M25-DOGFOOD-02`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Regenerate the TypeDuck-Web patch if source changed**

  If any file under `third_party/typeduck-web/source/` changed, regenerate `third_party/typeduck-web/patches/yune-typeduck-runtime.patch`, reverse-check it from `source/`, and forward-check it on a clean source checkout.

### Task 4: M25-DOGFOOD-03 Typing Responsiveness And Loading-State Separation

**Files:**
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/CandidatePanel.tsx`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/rime.ts`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/worker.ts`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/App.tsx`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Toolbar.tsx`
- Modify if profiling points there: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/yune-integration/adapter.ts`
- Modify if profiling points there: `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/src/typeduck.ts`
- Modify if profiling points there: `crates/yune-rime-api/src/typeduck_web.rs`
- Test: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/yune-typeduck.spec.ts`
- Evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-03/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add keypress latency instrumentation**

  Add temporary or permanent diagnostics that record `keydown` time, `Rime.processKey` queued time, worker receive time, Rust response time, page receive time, and candidate-panel render time. Save a browser JSON baseline for `h`, `ha`, `hai`, `nei`, and `jigaajiusihaa` under `M25-DOGFOOD-03`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add a failing Playwright responsiveness test**

  Add a Playwright test that types into the real textarea using actual keypresses and asserts an explicit latency budget for keydown-to-candidate update. The first version should fail or record the current bad p95/p99 latency so the implementation has a hard target.

- [ ] **Step 3: Separate global loading state from normal composition**

  `è¼‰å…¥ä¸­ Loading...` should mean startup, schema deploy, or settings redeploy, not ordinary per-key composition. Split loading state in `App.tsx`/`Toolbar.tsx`/`rime.ts` so normal `processKey`, `stageAi`, page flip, and candidate selection do not keep the global loading indicator active. If an action needs a local pending state, show it near that control instead of blocking the textbox.

- [ ] **Step 4: Avoid queueing keystrokes behind long non-key actions**

  Inspect the `rime.ts` single-message queue. If `processKey` messages wait behind startup/customize/deploy, split high-priority key events from low-priority settings work, coalesce stale option/customize calls, or block typing until the IME is truly ready with an explicit disabled state. Do not let the user type into an apparently live IME while key events are silently delayed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Reduce the slowest measured per-key path**

  If latency is dominated by Rust `process_key`, profile `yune_typeduck_process_key` and candidate serialization. If latency is dominated by rendering, cap rendered rows through `M25-DOGFOOD-02` and avoid rebuilding expensive dictionary/detail data for every row. If latency is dominated by AI staging, ensure AI remains second-pass, cancellable/stale-result guarded, and default-off.

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove typing responsiveness after the fix**

  Re-run the browser responsiveness test and save `typing-latency-after.json` with before/after p50/p95/p99 timings. The final evidence must show the textbox accepts keypresses without a visible one-second stall and the global loading indicator does not appear for normal composition.

- [ ] **Step 7: Regenerate the TypeDuck-Web patch if source changed**

  If any file under `third_party/typeduck-web/source/` changed, regenerate `third_party/typeduck-web/patches/yune-typeduck-runtime.patch`, reverse-check it from `source/`, and forward-check it on a clean source checkout.

### Task 5: M25-DOGFOOD-04 Compact Schema Switcher And Luna Label

**Files:**
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/App.tsx`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Toolbar.tsx`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/SchemaSwitcher.tsx`
- Modify: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/consts.ts`
- Modify if segment markup needs shared layout changes: `third_party/typeduck-web/source/src/Inputs.tsx`
- Test: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/yune-typeduck.spec.ts`
- Evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m25-dogfooding/M25-DOGFOOD-04/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Preserve the schema-name verification**

  Keep `schema-switcher-toolbar-and-luna-name-report.json` as the issue baseline. The implementation should treat the current web label `普通話` as a UI/source mismatch to resolve, not as proof that the user-facing label is correct. Upstream `1.17.0` names `luna_pinyin` as `朙月拼音`; TypeDuck v1.1.2 names it `普通話`, so any decision to keep `普通話` must be documented in this row with explicit TypeDuck-specific rationale.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add failing browser layout coverage**

  Add a Playwright test that loads `/web/` at a desktop viewport and asserts the schema switcher belongs to the same top control band as the ASCII/simplification/full-shape buttons. The test should check that `[data-yune-schema-switcher]` is inside or directly owned by the toolbar/top-controls component, the top edges of the three mode buttons and schema segments are aligned within one compact row, and no separate standalone schema block appears between the toolbar and status strip. Add a narrow viewport assertion that the same controls wrap within one compact band instead of becoming a separate full-width section.

- [ ] **Step 3: Move the schema switcher into the toolbar row**

  Refactor `Toolbar.tsx` to accept `activeSchema` and `setActiveSchema`, render `SchemaSwitcher` next to the three mode buttons, and keep the loading indicator in the same top control area without pushing the textarea downward. Remove the standalone `<SchemaSwitcher ... />` call from `App.tsx`. Keep accessible labels for each schema option and preserve the existing `data-yune-schema-switcher` hook for tests.

- [ ] **Step 4: Make the Luna label explicit**

  Update `SCHEMA_OPTIONS` in `consts.ts` so `luna_pinyin` uses `朙月拼音` as the primary visible `schemaName`. Keep `Luna Pinyin` or `Mandarin` only as a secondary label or tooltip if useful. Do not change engine output/ranking behavior for this UI-only row.

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove schema switching still works**

  In the browser test, switch from `jyut6ping3_mobile` to `luna_pinyin` and back, assert the visible active option changes, assert the Luna option text includes `朙月拼音`, and type a short smoke input after switching to prove the selector still drives the worker path.

- [ ] **Step 6: Capture visual evidence**

  Save desktop and narrow-viewport screenshots plus a JSON summary under `M25-DOGFOOD-04`. The JSON should include viewport size, active schema before/after switching, bounding boxes for the three mode buttons and schema switcher, and the visible text for the Luna option.

- [ ] **Step 7: Regenerate the TypeDuck-Web patch if source changed**

  If any file under `third_party/typeduck-web/source/` changed, regenerate `third_party/typeduck-web/patches/yune-typeduck-runtime.patch`, reverse-check it from `source/`, and forward-check it on a clean source checkout.

## Execution Order After Intake

When the feedback list exists, execute in this order unless the ledger explicitly says otherwise:

1. Reproduce and capture evidence for all `Needs triage` and `Browser integration` rows.
2. Fix runtime/browser correctness rows before broad UI polish.
3. Capture or reuse pinned oracle fixtures before any `Engine correctness` implementation.
4. Batch adjacent UI polish only when it touches the same local components and does not blur issue ownership.
5. Regenerate and reverse/forward check the TypeDuck-Web patch after every source-changing slice.
6. Close ledger rows as evidence lands; do not wait until the end to update row status.
7. Run focused gates for touched layers, then broad closeout gates if the batch changes shared behavior.

## Closeout Gates

Before M25 can be archived:

```powershell
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
npm.cmd --prefix packages/yune-typeduck-runtime test
npm.cmd --prefix packages/yune-typeduck-runtime run build
npm.cmd --prefix third_party/typeduck-web/source run build
git diff --check
```

Run the real TypeDuck-Web Playwright tests for every closed browser-visible row. If source files under `third_party/typeduck-web/source/` changed, also run the patch reverse/forward checks from this plan.

## Archive Rule

Archive this plan only after all M25 rows are `Closed`, `Deferred`, or `Rejected` with evidence/rationale. Update `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/requirements.md` only for durable milestone status or new requirements, not for every intake row.
