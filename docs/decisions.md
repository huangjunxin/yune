# Yune Decision Log

This is the consolidated decision log for Yune. The GSD planning system that
previously lived under `.planning/` has been **retired**; this file preserves the
durable decisions and their rationale so that future work does not lose the
reasoning behind the current architecture.

It harvests decisions from the retired `.planning/PROJECT.md` "Key Decisions"
table and Context/Constraints prose, the `.planning/STATE.md` "Accumulated
Context > Decisions" list, and the `decisions:` / `D-NN` entries in the phase
`PLAN`/`SUMMARY`/`RESEARCH`/`CONTEXT` documents.

A note on IDs: the per-phase `D-NN` identifiers used inside `.planning/phases/*`
were **phase-local** (Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 7, and Phase 10 each restarted at
`D-01`). The numbered `D-12`..`D-23` IDs in this log are the **project-wide**
IDs from `STATE.md` and are preserved verbatim. Earlier, unnumbered project-wide
decisions are assigned `D-01`..`D-11` here in rough chronological order. Phase-local
decisions are folded into the relevant project-wide entry or captured as the
`D-P<phase>-<n>` entries below; they are not renumbered against the project-wide
sequence.

## Standing principles

Cross-cutting decisions that govern all current and future work:

- **librime is the compatibility oracle, not an architecture template.** librime
  defines the externally observable contract (schema semantics, config behavior,
  candidate output, C ABI expectations, deployed-data compatibility, frontend
  integration). The implementation is free to be idiomatic, typed Rust internally
  as long as the boundary contract is preserved. Preserve librime-*observable
  behavior*, not librime's internal C++ complexity.

- **AI-native input is a separate, local-first, non-blocking, source-labeled
  layer.** LLM assistance is layered as optional candidate providers, rankers,
  context providers, and memory stores with timeout/fallback policy. AI results
  must be source-labeled, optional, and safe to discard, and they must never block
  or slow classic input. Classic input stays predictable and low-latency without
  network access; remote model calls can never be required for baseline input.
  Context/memory collection must be opt-in, inspectable, clearable, and disabled
  for sensitive contexts.

- **Build compatibility fixtures and ABI tests before replacing modules.**
  Behavior must be measurable against librime before any difference can be
  classified as an improvement or a regression. Each new behavior slice names its
  owning implementation module, owning test module, and librime comparison target
  before code changes; new failing comparisons/fixtures come before dispatch or
  state-mutation changes.

- **Module and test ownership per slice; `lib.rs`/`main.rs` stay facades.** Each
  compatibility slice owns its implementation module and test module. `lib.rs`
  (and `main.rs`) remain thin facades plus facade-owned tests; cross-cutting
  behavior tests live under per-crate `tests/` modules. Mechanical refactors
  preserve observable behavior and assertions; they do not rewrite working slices.

- **Plugin ABI compatibility is deferred.** Full C++ librime plugin ABI
  compatibility (Lua, octagram, predict, proto, etc.) is expensive and not yet
  required by a concrete frontend or schema-migration path. Deferred until a real
  distribution requirement makes it necessary.

- **Web-first sequencing.** Validate TypeDuck-Web in a real browser before
  resuming TypeDuck-Windows native work. Shared engine slices (comment shaping,
  Cantonese goldens, baseline fixes) are reused by the web path; Windows-specific
  native packaging stays parked until browser validation succeeds.

## Decision log

### Foundational decisions (from PROJECT.md Key Decisions and Context/Constraints)

**D-01 — Use librime as the compatibility oracle, not an architecture template.**
Existing schemas and frontends depend on librime contracts, but Rust can model the
internals more cleanly. Prefer typed, idiomatic Rust modules over cloning librime's
C++ structure when the boundary contract is preserved. *Outcome: Good.*

**D-02 — Build compatibility fixtures and ABI tests before replacing deeper engine
modules.** Behavior must be measurable before differences can be classified as
improvements or regressions. *Outcome: Good.*

**D-03 — Keep AI ranking optional and local-first.** Classic input must remain
predictable and low-latency without network access. *Outcome: Pending.*

**D-04 — Treat AI-native input as a separate product layer above compatibility.**
librime cannot guide LLM-native behavior, so Yune needs explicit provider, context,
memory, fallback, and privacy contracts. *Outcome: Pending.*

**D-05 — Treat the module/test refactor as a structural rule for future feature
work.** Large single-file accumulation slowed review, search, focused testing, and
extraction; module/test ownership per slice with `lib.rs`/`main.rs` as facades is
now the rule. *Outcome: Pending.*

**D-06 — Keep plugin ABI compatibility deferred.** Plugin compatibility is
expensive and not yet required by a concrete frontend or schema-migration path.
*Outcome: Pending.*

**D-07 — Treat runtime resource identifiers as logical IDs, not arbitrary
filesystem paths.** Schema-controlled dictionary/import/pack/vocabulary IDs are
validated (rejecting drive prefixes, backslashes, traversal) before any runtime
data path is constructed; explicit user-supplied import/export/restore file paths
remain arbitrary paths, but the derived logical names joined into runtime roots are
validated. Boundaries fail closed (FALSE, -1, None, Value::Null).

**D-08 — Source `.dict.yaml` support is not sufficient for production-scale
compatibility.** Compiled `.table.bin`, `.prism.bin`, and `.reverse.bin` payload
consumption and rebuild execution remain a required direction.

**D-09 — The CLI frontend is a validation surrogate, not native UI.** It drives
`yune-rime-api` to validate the ABI; it is not proof that Squirrel, Weasel,
ibus-rime, fcitx-rime, or fcitx5-rime integration is complete, and it is not a new
graphical end-user frontend.

**D-10 — Cloud inference is never a required runtime dependency.** Classic input and
the first AI-native layer must remain local-first and low-latency; remote LLM use is
an optional enhancement only.

**D-11 — Privacy boundaries for context and memory.** Context and memory collection
must be opt-in, inspectable, clearable, and disabled for sensitive contexts; remote
model calls cannot be required for baseline input.

### Phase 1 — CLI frontend surrogate

**D-P1-1 — Keep existing core-backed `run`/`check` commands; add separate
ABI-backed `frontend`/`frontend-check` commands.** The CLI gains an ABI-driven path
without disturbing the existing core-backed commands.

**D-P1-2 — Localize unsafe RIME ABI handling to `rime_frontend.rs`.** All ABI
functions are acquired through `rime_get_api()`/`RimeApi`; each populated
commit/context/status read is paired with its matching free function; an RAII
cleanup guard runs `destroy_session`/`cleanup_all_sessions`/`finalize` on success
and error paths.

**D-P1-3 — Move deterministic transcript serialization to `transcript.rs`.**
`FrontendRun::to_json` becomes a compatibility delegation; owned
`FrontendEvent`/`FrontendContext` carry keycode, mask, page metadata, and select
keys/labels so serializers never read raw ABI pointers. Native frontend validation
is marked Phase 2 scope.

### Phase 2 — Native ABI validation and runtime safety

**D-P2-1 — Validate the Cargo-built cdylib through a dynamic loader.** A
`libloading` Cargo integration test resolves `rime_get_api` and drives the returned
`RimeApi` function table against the real `yune-rime-api` cdylib; `cargo build -p
yune-rime-api` is required before the loader gate because `cargo test` alone does
not guarantee the artifact exists. The `Library` value is kept alive for the whole
symbol/table scope; the loader fails closed with distinct messages for missing
artifact, load error, missing symbol, null table, null function pointer, and runtime
failure.

**D-P2-2 — Keep runtime implementation unchanged where lifecycle regressions pass.**
The absence of loader-exposed concurrency defects is recorded as an explicit
lifecycle-safety assertion rather than broadening into multi-threaded frontend
behavior. Notification ordering is asserted with full context/session/type/value
tuples.

**D-P2-3 — Limit Phase 2 fixes to ABI/runtime boundaries.** Schema semantics,
compiled-dictionary behavior, and userdb storage compatibility stay deferred to
later phases and are recorded only as structured findings.

### Phase 3 — Schema pipeline depth

**D-P3-1 — Model non-auto previous-match splitting in `processors/speller.rs`
without `lib.rs` dispatch changes.** The remaining input is preserved without
emitting an unread commit; the splitting stays bounded to one appended spelling-key
path.

**D-P3-2 — Lock existing editor/navigator/selector and chord/punctuation/fallback
behavior with schema-loaded ABI fixtures.** Coverage is added as ABI-facing
regression fixtures where existing owned behavior already matched the focused
visible state.

**D-P3-3 — Make unmodeled gears explicit deferrals, not silent no-ops.** `memory`
defers to Phase 5 (userdb learning); `poet`/`grammar`, `contextual_translation`,
and `unity_table_encoder` defer to Phase 4 (compiled payloads). Each is recorded as
a `RemainingGearDeferral` (gear, observed librime role, current Yune behavior, scope
decision, target phase) during schema installation — a deterministic no-op, not an
ABI-exposed compatibility claim.

**D-P3-4 — Compare against real librime schemas (`luna_pinyin`, `cangjie5`) and
record out-of-phase gaps as structured findings.** Distribution comparisons assert
focused categories (component order, segment tags, generated spellings, OpenCC/filter
behavior, punctuation/fallback, candidate differences); converted differences stay in
the comparison module with owner comments rather than changing production code.

**D-P3-5 — Use schema-loaded ABI fixtures for spelling algebra, correction/tolerance
ranking, and OpenCC filter-chain behavior.** OpenCC assertions cover filter-chain tag
gating and limited built-in maps only; no full OpenCC conversion-data parity is
claimed, and no compiled-payload/LevelDB/plugin/AI-native code is added.

### Phase 4 — Compiled dictionary data

**D-P4-1 — Keep compiled binary layout parsing in `yune-core` byte-slice readers;
`schema_install.rs` only does validated resource selection.** Valid source-only
dictionaries are normal runtime behavior; stale/invalid/unsupported compiled
artifacts record fallback diagnostics. Unsupported MARISA/Darts sections fail closed
with structured `UnsupportedSection` errors.

**D-P4-2 — Compute deployment freshness from source/schema/pack checksums, not
mtimes.** `RimeDictRebuildExecutionReport` statuses for table/prism/reverse artifacts
let deployment tests assert partial rebuild/reuse; rebuild execution stays entirely
in Rust by emitting the local compiled formats the readers accept; generated schema
build metadata is normalized out of prism signatures.

**D-P4-3 (project-wide, dated 04-03) — Represent advanced source and compiled
dictionary data on `TableDictionary`, not parallel runtime-specific structs.** Use
bounded local Yune fixture markers for advanced compiled-payload parity while
rejecting unsupported librime sections structurally; carry compiled reverse
`dict_settings` into runtime table dictionaries so `ReverseLookupTranslator` observes
source and compiled settings through the same API. LevelDB/userdb learning,
predictive updates, plugin translators, and AI-native ranking stay out of scope.

**D-P4-4 (project-wide, dated 04-04) — Represent correction/tolerance data as
normalized `TableDictionary` metadata merged through compiled/source paths.** Lookup
expansion preserves original input first, then correction canonicalization, then
tolerance candidates. Correction/tolerance parser counts are capped before allocation;
malformed compiled sections fall back with structured diagnostics
(`YUNE-CORR`/`YUNE-TOL` fixture markers with checked offsets, lengths, UTF-8, count
caps). Tests use local Rust-generated fixture bytes only; no librime compiler is
invoked.

### Phase 5 — UserDB and scaling hardening

**D-P5-1 — Use file snapshots and atomic rename semantics instead of a LevelDB
dependency.** Exported `RimeLevers*UserDict*` functions stay in `userdb.rs` with
storage behavior behind internal userdb modules; legacy plain-text userdb import
compatibility is preserved while committing typed c/d/t records.

**D-P5-2 — Classic learning stays commit-driven.** `Engine` emits typed pending
userdb events (`take_pending_userdb_learning`) before clearing composition; session
persistence consumes them only through normal commit paths. Core userdb is
storage-neutral; `yune-rime-api` bridges core events to the store and validates
logical dictionary names before storage selection. Schema-selected userdb loading is
keyed by the table/script-translator dictionary, not the schema-id fallback, so
unrelated schema tests do not inherit persisted learning. `HistoryTranslator`,
`CandidateRanker`, `MockAiRanker`, and AI memory are not substitutes for classic
userdb learning; userdb candidates enter before optional rankers.

**D-P5-3 — Test splits follow behavior ownership and stay separate from semantic
changes.** Levers user-dictionary iterator/file-operation tests move to
`yune-rime-api/src/tests/userdb.rs` (owner: userdb lifecycle); engine/translator/
filter behavior tests move out of `lib.rs`; key/dictionary/facade-specific and
already-owned tests stay put until their owning modules are targeted. `yune-core/
src/lib.rs` stays a facade plus facade-owned tests.

### Phase 6 — Real frontend validation and benchmark

**D-P6-1 — Anchor native frontend validation at the cdylib `RimeApi` boundary with
sanitized deterministic traces.** `FrontendHostTrace` captures ordered calls,
notifications, free-pairs, stale sessions, and mismatches using logical resource IDs
and deterministic event names (no paths, timestamps, PIDs, or pointer addresses);
missing required function pointers are represented as blocker-capable mismatch records
before any unchecked call.

**D-P6-2 — Model TypeDuck-Web as a minimized browser/WASM call sequence through
Yune-owned `RimeApi` calls, without vendoring source.** Emscripten worker lifecycle,
IDBFS persistence, and unavailable native dynamic loading are classified as
`browser_wasm_limit` observations rather than Yune ABI failures; the observation is a
sanitized fixture with mismatch classification "match" (no Yune ABI/runtime mismatch
found). The 06-01 host-trace schema is reused rather than inventing target-specific
formats.

**D-P6-3 (project-wide, dated 06-03) — Represent Squirrel/macOS validation as a
source-modeled `RimeApi` lifecycle fixture plus a documented direct-run blocker**,
rather than a mandatory app bundle or input-method registration step. Linux
ibus-rime/fcitx-rime validation remains follow-up documentation with safe ABI
source-model markers in `native_frontends.rs`, not a required daemon dependency for
`cargo test`. Native frontend mismatch capture reuses the Phase 6 host-trace schema
and sanitized fixture rules.

**D-P6-4 (project-wide, benchmark/readiness notes) — Use a dependency-free Cargo
bench target instead of Criterion** to preserve MSRV safety and avoid unnecessary
benchmark infrastructure. BENCH-01/BENCH-02 measurements stay at the `rime_get_api` /
`RimeApi` function-table boundary rather than direct `yune-core` calls. AI-native
readiness is recorded as **GO WITH CONDITIONS**, based on Phase 6 validation and
benchmarks, while keeping providers, rankers, context policy, memory policy, and
privacy controls out of scope.

### Phase 7 — WASM build and export contract

**D-P7-1 — Treat `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` as the browser build target, not
`wasm-bindgen`.** TypeDuck-Web-style integration needs Emscripten C ABI exports and
filesystem/runtime hooks. Document `EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS`/`EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS`
as the browser build contract without changing `lib.rs` facade wiring.

**D-P7-2 — The browser export surface is the seeded `yune_typeduck_*` adapter API.**
init, process-key, select-candidate, delete-candidate, flip-page, deploy, customize,
cleanup, response-json, response-handled, free-response. `scripts/typeduck-exports.txt`
is the canonical non-prefixed export list (one symbol per line, no `RimeApi` symbols).

**D-P7-3 — Keep the Rust adapter inside `crates/yune-rime-api`; do not create a
separate adapter crate** unless planning proves the contract cannot be expressed
safely from the existing cdylib.

**D-P7-4 — Add deterministic native + Emscripten export verification that must not
mutate the `RimeApi` table.** A POSIX shell script verifies native exports (`nm -g`
against the export list, accepting macOS leading underscores) before browser
prerequisite detection; missing `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`/`emcc`/`emar` are
deterministic, actionable blockers only when `cargo test -p yune-rime-api --test
typeduck_web` passes. Native adapter contract tests in
`crates/yune-rime-api/tests/typeduck_web.rs` are the authoritative fallback.

**D-P7-5 — Document the one-active-process-global-service constraint and host
filesystem assumptions.** `yune_typeduck_cleanup` finalizes the process-global RIME
service; multiple simultaneous TypeDuck states with different dirs are unsupported by
this first contract. Treat missing browser schema/dictionary assets as an init-time
failure before starting the service. Phase 7 is a handoff contract: one active
process-global service, host-owned MEMFS/IDBFS layout and sync, and deterministic
verified-or-blocked build output. Upstream clone/replace testing is Phase 10.

### Phase 8 — TypeScript bridge and runtime package

**D-P8-1 — Keep TypeScript tooling package-local under
`packages/yune-typeduck-runtime`.** No root JS app scaffolding. Bind only the
canonical 11 `yune_typeduck_*` exports through an injected Emscripten Module
interface.

**D-P8-2 — Centralize response-pointer ownership.** `readTypeDuckResponse` frees
non-null responses in a `finally` block; `TypeDuckRuntime` keeps `statePtr` private,
zeros it on cleanup, and rejects operations after cleanup; keyboard mapping is
DOM-free (`keyEventToRimeKey` maps `event.key` to explicit RIME constants, bans
`keyCode`).

**D-P8-3 — Make native handled state authoritative and normalize malformed JSON.**
`yune_typeduck_response_handled` can override the JSON envelope; malformed JSON
becomes a deterministic `TypeDuckResponseError`.

**D-P8-4 — Document `@yune-ime/typeduck-runtime` as repository-owned bridge code,
not a TypeDuck-Web app scaffold.** Keep the low-level C/WASM export contract
alongside wrapper guidance so non-wrapper hosts can follow raw pointer ownership
rules; wrapper callers receive parsed `TypeDuckResponse` objects while raw callers
copy JSON before `yune_typeduck_free_response`.

### Phase 9 — Browser filesystem and persistence

**D-P9-1 — Keep filesystem behind a narrow `TypeDuckFilesystem` interface and require
explicit assets.** Require explicit `dictionaryId` and asset contents rather than
parsing YAML or fabricating fallback assets; mirror all five native preflight paths
before `TypeDuckRuntime.init` (shared default/schema/dict plus build default/schema).
Browser helper code stays DOM-free, network-free, package-local under Vitest fake-fs
tests; logical IDs must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` before virtual-path construction.

**D-P9-2 — Keep persistence orchestration as standalone helpers in `filesystem.ts`.**
Do not modify `TypeDuckRuntime` or native exports. Use
`syncFromPersistenceBeforeInit` before init and `syncToPersistenceAfterMutation`
after deploy/customize/cleanup/userdb boundaries; expose sync direction as
`fromPersistence`/`toPersistence` strings that lock the Emscripten `syncfs` populate
boolean.

**D-P9-3 — Userdb persistence is an explicit host sync boundary
(`syncAfterUserDataChange`).** Current native exports do not expose userdb mutation
notifications, so the host owns the sync boundary. Stale deployed-config recovery is
a deterministic test fixture over existing helpers, not a metadata heuristic; recovery
documentation stays local-first and caller-owned (explicit assets, explicit sync
boundaries, no browser app/network/cache policy).

### Phase 10 — TypeDuck-Web app integration and E2E

**D-P10-1 — Clone upstream TypeDuck-Web to `third_party/typeduck-web/source`
(gitignored), treated as the app under test.** Use a reproducible, auditable checkout
(pinned `https://github.com/TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Web` URL + full commit SHA + setup
command in a lock JSON and README). Inspect and document the existing librime/WASM
seam before any patching, so app-source changes stay distinguishable from Yune adapter
changes.

**D-P10-2 — Keep TypeDuck-Web source changes minimal; route engine calls through the
Phase 8/9 package surface.** Prefer a patch/configuration layer over UI rewrites; the
seam calls `TypeDuckRuntime`, `keyEventToRimeKey`, filesystem preparation, and
persistence sync helpers from `@yune-ime/typeduck-runtime` rather than raw
`yune_typeduck_*` exports. Preserve one active runtime per Emscripten Module with
deterministic cleanup; do not promise multi-instance browser isolation.

**D-P10-3 — Use explicit TypeDuck-Web-owned assets; never fabricate fallback
schema/dictionary data.** Missing or mismatched `default.yaml`/schema/dictionary YAML
remain visible integration failures (grep-gated against fallback/dummy/placeholder
wording).

**D-P10-4 — Record adapter mismatches before widening Yune.** Map missing
`TypeDuckContext` properties to defaults (comments, `highlighted_candidate_index`);
document the `setOption` gap as an error rather than implementing a workaround; widen
the Yune adapter only for the smallest proven blocker, documented first.

**D-P10-5 — Real browser validation is required and never silently skipped.** Use a
standalone Playwright spec (upstream has no browser test framework) covering
composition, candidate paging, selection, deletion, commit output, deploy, customize,
and persistence smoke; persistence follows the Phase 9 explicit sync contract
(populate before init, flush after mutation, reload/reinitialize to prove survival).
Missing browser/local tooling is recorded reproducibly (command, missing dependency,
fallback evidence). Asset configuration was recorded as an E2E blocker, not a build
blocker.

**D-12 / TYPEDUCK-E2E-04 — Final findings separate three blocker classes.**
TypeDuck-Web app/source blockers, Yune adapter/runtime mismatches, and
environment/tooling blockers are reported separately.

**D-13 / TYPEDUCK-E2E-04 — Phase 10 ends with a NO-GO recommendation for AI-native
frontend exposure** due to browser-validation blockers. Strict rubric: lack of
browser evidence prevents GO / GO WITH CONDITIONS. Blockers are bounded
(cargo/rustup/emcc have install paths), not a fundamental seam incompatibility; the
seam patch is structurally sound and the adapter handles mismatches — environment
setup is the gating requirement.

**D-14 — AI-native scope remains deferred.** AI-native provider calls, candidate
generation, ranking, context, memory, privacy controls, and a new first-party Yune
frontend remain out of scope.

### TypeDuck-Windows milestone (project-wide D-15..D-22)

**D-15 / WIN-TEST-01 — TypeDuck-Windows native IME is the next tracked milestone;
first unblock Windows test trust before feature work.**

**D-16 / WIN-ABI-01 — Fork-only config list-append APIs are the first feature
slice** after the Windows baseline, because they need no external oracle.

**D-17 / WIN-ORACLE-01 — Comment semantics and Cantonese/Jyutping parity must be
driven by TypeDuck-HK/librime v1.1.2 goldens or documented blockers.**

**D-18 / WIN-ABI-01 — TypeDuck fork list-append fields are inserted after
`config_list_size` and before `config_begin_list`,** matching the fork `RimeApi`
order; scalar append values follow the existing string-backed `RimeConfigSet*`
representation.

**D-19 / WIN-ORACLE-01 — Pin the v1.1.2 oracle commits.** `TypeDuck-HK/librime`
commit `74cb52b78fb2411137a7643f6c8bc6517acfde69`, `rime-dictionary-lookup-filter`
commit `3e4605c4fae99f068df2edb85aaeab5a97752795`, and `TypeDuck-HK/schema` commit
`1bed1ae6a0ab48055f073774d7dfd152a171c548`.

**D-20 / WIN-COMMENT-01 — Represent TypeDuck-Windows candidate comments as source-row
dictionary lookup payloads (`\f\r1,...\r0,...`) through `dictionary_lookup_filter`.**
Captured source rows assert byte output against the v1.1.2 fixture. Normal reverse
lookup joins use `"; "`, but that join and schema-name prompt parity still need
dedicated oracle coverage.

**D-21 / WIN-BUILD-01 — The native Windows package is produced by
`scripts/package-typeduck-windows.ps1`.** It builds `yune-rime-api` for
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, renames the DLL/import library to `rime.dll`/`rime.lib`,
copies TypeDuck fork headers, and smoke-checks `rime_get_api` plus the
`config_list_append_string` slot.

**D-22 / WIN-PARITY-01 — The Cantonese/Jyutping parity suite locks captured v1.1.2
schema/menu/comment behavior** and keeps uncaptured option, completion, correction,
schema-menu, and userdb-pronunciation behaviors as explicit ignored tests until
dedicated oracle fixtures are captured.

### Web-first re-sequencing (project-wide D-23)

**D-23 / SEQUENCING — Re-sequence to web-first.** Validate Yune in a real web browser
(reopened as Phase 17) before resuming TypeDuck-Windows platform work. Phase 10's
NO-GO reflected absent browser evidence (the WASM artifact was never built), not a
failed seam. Shared engine slices (comment shaping, Cantonese goldens, baseline fix)
are reused by the web path; Windows-specific native packaging (Phases 11–16) is parked
until browser validation succeeds.

### Initialization notes (process decisions)

**D-INIT-1 — Existing `docs/analysis.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`,
`docs/plans/refactor-plan.md`, and `.planning/codebase/` are the source context** for
the (now retired) GSD project; external research was skipped at setup because scope
was driven by existing docs and direct librime comparison.

**D-INIT-2 — Future compatibility slices must choose module ownership, test
ownership, and the librime comparison target before implementation.** (Captured as a
standing principle; see "Standing principles" and D-05.)
