# Roadmap

Yune is a Rust input-method engine that uses **librime as a compatibility
oracle** while building toward an AI-native input engine librime cannot provide.
The strategy: make existing RIME schemas and frontends behave predictably through
Yune, measuring every difference against librime before accepting it, then layer
AI-native behavior on top as a separate product milestone.

> **Compatibility oracle.** Upstream librime latest stable is the default core
> behavior reference for user-visible behavior, schema semantics, standard ABI
> contracts, deployed data, and migration. The current pinned upstream target is
> `rime/librime 1.17.0`
> (`33e78140250125871856cdc5b42ddc6a5fcd3cd4`):
> <https://github.com/rime/librime>. TypeDuck-specific behavior is referenced
> only as a compatibility profile against the TypeDuck fork (tag `v1.1.2`,
> commit `74cb52b78fb2411137a7643f6c8bc6517acfde69`):
> <https://github.com/TypeDuck-HK/librime>. (Earlier docs referenced a local
> checkout path; treat the GitHub sources above as canonical.)

## Completed

### M0–M4: Foundation
- Rust workspace (`yune-core`, `yune-schema`, `yune-rime-api`, `yune-cli`); core session/candidate types; CLI smoke test.
- Deterministic compatibility harness: recorded fixtures, JSON output for context/candidates/commit/status, workspace tests.
- RIME-style schema subset: processors, segmentors, translators, filters as named components; config patch/include behavior.
- Table dictionary prototype with deterministic lookup and ranking.
- Non-blocking candidate reranking trait with a mock ranker; classic ordering preserved as fallback.

### M5–M7: RIME ABI, schema, and data compatibility
- Focused RIME-style C ABI (`yune-rime-api`): sessions, context/status/commit, config, levers, schema lists, deployment, modules, runtime options, key processing — driven through the exported `RimeApi` function table.
- Broad librime-compatible key-table coverage and aligned core/ABI key handling.
- Schema-loaded compatibility across the high-value processor/segmentor/translator/filter set (speller, editor, navigator, selector, chord, punctuation, shape; abc/ascii/affix/matcher segmentors; table/script/r10n/reverse-lookup/history/switch/schema-list translators; simplifier/uniquifier/charset/reverse-lookup filters).
- Source `.dict.yaml` parsing aligned with librime/yaml-cpp edge cases; `import_tables`; preset vocabulary; table-encoder primitives; checksum/rebuild-plan groundwork.
- Compiled `.table.bin`/`.prism.bin`/`.reverse.bin` payload consumption and rebuild execution; correction/tolerance data in the compiled path.
- UserDB compatibility beyond the plain-text shim: storage, snapshot/restore/recovery/sync, transaction rollback, learning, frequency updates, predictive lookup.

Detail: [`plans/archive/compat-foundation-summary.md`](./plans/archive/compat-foundation-summary.md), [`plans/archive/refactor-plan.md`](./plans/archive/refactor-plan.md) (module/test ownership rules), and the [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md) log.

### M8: Real frontend validation & benchmarks
- Host-shaped native loader validates the full `rime_get_api` → setup → deploy → schema select → session → key process → context/status → commit → teardown lifecycle.
- Squirrel/macOS and ibus/fcitx Linux paths attempted and documented with reproducible blockers (not claimed as completed native integration).
- Frontend-sensitive benchmark baselines for session lifecycle, per-key processing, deploy/dictionary loading, and userdb learning/sync.
- **Outcome:** *GO WITH CONDITIONS* to begin AI-native candidate/ranking **design**.

Detail: [`plans/archive/real-frontend-validation-plan.md`](./plans/archive/real-frontend-validation-plan.md), [`plans/archive/frontend-validation/`](./plans/archive/frontend-validation/).

### M9: TypeDuck-Web browser validation

- Emscripten build emits loadable `yune-typeduck.js`/`.wasm` glue, and a Node
  smoke instantiates it, calls a `yune_typeduck_*` export, and performs an
  Emscripten `FS` write/read.
- TypeDuck-Web adapter maps runtime `candidate.text`, `candidate.comment`, and
  `context.highlighted` into the upstream candidate panel shape.
- Patched TypeDuck-Web worker calls the modular Emscripten factory, mounts IDBFS,
  fetches real `public/schema` assets before init, and runs in a real browser.
- **Browser result:** the HR-5 real-assets matrix passes for composition,
  candidate list, paging, selection, deletion, Space commit, phrase commit,
  deploy, customize, persistence sync, reload survival, and dictionary-panel
  rendering against `jyut6ping3_mobile`; the committed byte-parity guarantee
  for rich dictionary comments is the `cantonese_parity` fixture, with the
  browser-shaped native rich-comment test enabled when local v1.1.2 oracle
  build assets are present. HR-6 also locks the shared reverse-lookup `"; "`
  joiner and schema-prompt bytes against the TypeDuck v1.1.2 oracle.
- **Outcome:** **GO WITH CONDITIONS** for AI-native frontend exposure. This
  supersedes the old tooling-blocked Phase 10 NO-GO and the interim hardening
  NO-GO: real browser compatibility is proven, but AI-native behavior remains
  disabled by default in real frontends until the M11 provider/ranking/privacy
  contracts are proven and explicitly enabled.

### M11: AI-native input layer — S1–S5 CLI/core complete *(2026-06-18; frontend exposure deferred)*

The AI-native layer (M11) is implemented in `crates/yune-core` and the direct
`yune-cli run` path only, leaving the TypeDuck-Web and TypeDuck-Windows frontend surfaces unchanged. The
core exposes an `AiCandidateProvider` interface, deterministic `MockAiProvider`,
and an `AiWorker` (provider execution is CLI-orchestrated outside
`Engine::refresh_candidates`; the engine consumes only staged, input-keyed
results); structured `Ai { provider, confidence }` source metadata with
fixed-point confidence; one merge function that pins the top classic candidate
at index 0; a default-sensitive `AiPrivacyPolicy` that blocks remote providers
before invocation and gates learning; an inspectable / clearable / disable-able
`MemoryStore` kept **outside** the librime `*.userdb` namespace; and a
deterministic local rule-backed provider (`yune-cli run --ai-provider local`).
All eight S1–S5 safety criteria are independently verified — source-labeled,
classic-first, non-blocking, no default auto-commit, **no userdb leak**,
privacy-gated, deterministic fallback. Real frontend exposure remains deferred
and default-off (see *Deferred / future*).

## Current baseline - M12: Upstream Oracle Refresh complete

Yune's core engine now tracks upstream `rime/librime 1.17.0` as the default
oracle target. M12 turned TypeDuck behavior into an explicit compatibility
profile instead of the default engine truth.

Detail: [`plans/archive/upstream-oracle-refresh.md`](./plans/archive/upstream-oracle-refresh.md).

**Status**:

| # | Work item | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Pin upstream oracle | Done | Upstream `1.17.0` commit `33e78140250125871856cdc5b42ddc6a5fcd3cd4` is the default core target; upstream provenance and the runtime byte-capture build blocker are documented. |
| 1 | Fixture naming policy | Done | Fixture manifests and the provenance guard test distinguish `upstream-1.17.0` from `typeduck-v1.1.2`. |
| 2 | TypeDuck assumption audit | Done | Existing TypeDuck-derived behavior is classified in `docs/plans/archive/m12-coverage-audit.md`. |
| 3 | First upstream parity slice | Done | Default `RimeApi` ABI parity was refreshed to `rime/librime 1.17.0`; fork-only `start_quick` and `config_list_append_*` slots are excluded from the core table. |

## Parked - M10: TypeDuck-Windows native backend

TypeDuck-Windows remains valuable, but it is no longer the active core-engine
priority. Its work is parked as a TypeDuck compatibility profile until Yune has
a named TypeDuck profile ABI surface.

Archived pre-M12 M10 evidence is preserved: Windows test trust, fork-only
`config_list_append_*` helper behavior, current TypeDuck comment shaping
fixtures, and a historical native `rime.dll`/`.lib`/headers package smoke. That
package smoke is not an active or valid gate for the default upstream
`rime_get_api()` table after M12. Remaining TypeDuck work is still blocked by
five uncaptured v1.1.2 Cantonese/Jyutping goldens and the real TypeDuck-Windows
frontend E2E.

Detail: [`typeduck-windows-backend-requirements.md`](./typeduck-windows-backend-requirements.md),
[`plans/yune-windows-contract-implementation-plan.md`](./plans/yune-windows-contract-implementation-plan.md),
and [`plans/yune-windows-native-build.md`](./plans/yune-windows-native-build.md).

## Concrete next steps

In priority order:

1. **Preserve the upstream-first baseline.** Keep default `RimeApi` and core behavior aligned to upstream `1.17.0`; add new TypeDuck fork-only behavior only behind an explicit profile surface.
2. **Keep M9 web gates green on merge.** Preserve the reproducible Emscripten build, TypeScript runtime tests/build, TypeDuck-Web worker build, real-assets browser evidence, and native `typeduck_web` fallback.
3. **Keep AI frontend exposure separate and default-off.** M11's CLI/core layer is complete; any future TypeDuck-Web, Windows, or other frontend exposure needs a new explicit plan and must preserve compatibility gates.
4. **Resume TypeDuck profile work only with a named surface.** Return to TypeDuck-Windows packaging after the profile ABI is defined and fork-header slot smoke is re-derived.

## Deferred / future

- **librime C++ plugin ABI** (Lua, octagram, predict, proto): deferred until a concrete frontend or distribution requires it; prefer Yune-native extension points first.
- **AI-native input layer (future frontend exposure)** - after the completed S1-S5 CLI/core mock/provider, worker/confidence, context/privacy, memory, and local-model slices, remaining AI-native work is product integration: exposing AI behind explicit defaults in real frontends without changing upstream-core, TypeDuck-Web, or parked TypeDuck-Windows compatibility behavior. The architecture remains in [`plans/ai-native-design.md`](./plans/ai-native-design.md); S1 evidence and checklist live in [`plans/archive/ai-native-cli-slice-plan.md`](./plans/archive/ai-native-cli-slice-plan.md).

## Principles (carried forward)

- **Oracle, not template.** Treat librime as the behavior oracle, but prefer idiomatic Rust, cleaner abstractions, stronger typing, and deterministic tests over cloning librime's internal C++ structure.
- **Name the behavior.** Before adding a librime-derived mechanism, name the external behavior it protects (user-visible input, frontend ABI, schema/config semantics, or deployed-data compatibility). If it's only an internal librime detail, use a smaller Yune-native design, isolate it behind an adapter, or document a deferral.
- **Own each slice.** Choose the owning implementation module, matching test module, and librime comparison target before writing a compatibility slice. Keep `lib.rs`/`main.rs` as facades.
