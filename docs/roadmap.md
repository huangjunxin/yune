# Roadmap

Yune is a Rust input-method engine that uses **librime as a compatibility
oracle** while building toward an AI-native input engine librime cannot provide.
The strategy: make existing RIME schemas and frontends behave predictably through
Yune, measuring every difference against librime before accepting it, then layer
AI-native behavior on top as a separate product milestone.

> **Compatibility oracle.** Upstream librime is the behavior reference for
> user-visible behavior, schema semantics, ABI contracts, and migration:
> <https://github.com/rime/librime>. Windows-specific behavior is referenced
> against the TypeDuck fork (tag `v1.1.2`):
> <https://github.com/TypeDuck-HK/librime>. (Earlier docs referenced a local
> checkout path; treat the GitHub sources above as canonical.)

## Completed

### M0–M4: Foundation
- Rust workspace (`yune-core`, `yune-schema`, `yune-rime-api`, `yune-cli`); core session/candidate types; CLI smoke test.
- Deterministic compatibility harness: recorded fixtures, JSON output for context/candidates/commit/status, workspace tests.
- RIME-style schema subset: processors, segmentors, translators, filters as named components; config patch/include behavior.
- Table dictionary prototype with deterministic lookup and ranking.
- Non-blocking candidate reranking trait with a mock ranker; classic ordering preserved as fallback.

### M5–M7: RIME ABI, schema, and data compatibility
- Focused RIME-style C ABI (`yune-rime-api`): sessions, context/status/commit, config, levers, schema lists, deployment, modules, runtime options, key processing — driven through the exported `RimeApi` function table.
- Broad librime-compatible key-table coverage and aligned core/ABI key handling.
- Schema-loaded compatibility across the high-value processor/segmentor/translator/filter set (speller, editor, navigator, selector, chord, punctuation, shape; abc/ascii/affix/matcher segmentors; table/script/r10n/reverse-lookup/history/switch/schema-list translators; simplifier/uniquifier/charset/reverse-lookup filters).
- Source `.dict.yaml` parsing aligned with librime/yaml-cpp edge cases; `import_tables`; preset vocabulary; table-encoder primitives; checksum/rebuild-plan groundwork.
- Compiled `.table.bin`/`.prism.bin`/`.reverse.bin` payload consumption and rebuild execution; correction/tolerance data in the compiled path.
- UserDB compatibility beyond the plain-text shim: storage, snapshot/restore/recovery/sync, transaction rollback, learning, frequency updates, predictive lookup.

Detail: [`plans/archive/compat-foundation-summary.md`](./plans/archive/compat-foundation-summary.md), [`plans/archive/refactor-plan.md`](./plans/archive/refactor-plan.md) (module/test ownership rules), and the [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md) log.

### M8: Real frontend validation & benchmarks
- Host-shaped native loader validates the full `rime_get_api` → setup → deploy → schema select → session → key process → context/status → commit → teardown lifecycle.
- Squirrel/macOS and ibus/fcitx Linux paths attempted and documented with reproducible blockers (not claimed as completed native integration).
- Frontend-sensitive benchmark baselines for session lifecycle, per-key processing, deploy/dictionary loading, and userdb learning/sync.
- **Outcome:** *GO WITH CONDITIONS* to begin AI-native candidate/ranking **design**.

Detail: [`plans/archive/real-frontend-validation-plan.md`](./plans/archive/real-frontend-validation-plan.md), [`plans/archive/frontend-validation/`](./plans/archive/frontend-validation/).

### M9: TypeDuck-Web browser validation

- Emscripten build emits loadable `yune-typeduck.js`/`.wasm` glue, and a Node
  smoke instantiates it, calls a `yune_typeduck_*` export, and performs an
  Emscripten `FS` write/read.
- TypeDuck-Web adapter maps runtime `candidate.text`, `candidate.comment`, and
  `context.highlighted` into the upstream candidate panel shape.
- Patched TypeDuck-Web worker calls the modular Emscripten factory, mounts IDBFS,
  fetches real `public/schema` assets before init, and runs in a real browser.
- **Browser result:** the HR-5 real-assets matrix passes for composition,
  candidate list, paging, selection, deletion, Space commit, phrase commit,
  deploy, customize, persistence sync, reload survival, and dictionary-panel
  comments against `jyut6ping3_mobile`. HR-6 also locks the shared
  reverse-lookup `"; "` joiner and schema-prompt bytes against the TypeDuck
  v1.1.2 oracle.
- **Outcome:** **GO WITH CONDITIONS** for AI-native frontend exposure. This
  supersedes the old tooling-blocked Phase 10 NO-GO and the interim hardening
  NO-GO: real browser compatibility is proven, but AI-native behavior remains
  disabled by default in real frontends until the M11 provider/ranking/privacy
  contracts are proven and explicitly enabled.

Detail: [`plans/typeduck-web-validation-plan.md`](./plans/typeduck-web-validation-plan.md), [`plans/typeduck-web-adapter.md`](./plans/typeduck-web-adapter.md), [`plans/typeduck-web-integration-findings.md`](./plans/typeduck-web-integration-findings.md), [`plans/archive/ai-native-frontend-readiness.md`](./plans/archive/ai-native-frontend-readiness.md) (HR-7 recommendation).

## In progress

> **Sequencing — web first.** The original plan stands: prove Yune in a real
> **web browser before** expanding to Windows and other native platforms. The
> M9's original *NO-GO* was a *tooling* block, not a behavioral one. The
> post-review hardening round found that the first WI-4 matrix used the
> placeholder echo path for candidate evidence; HR-5 reran the matrix against
> real TypeDuck assets, and HR-6 locked the remaining shared joiner/prompt oracle
> slice. M9 is now closed as **GO WITH CONDITIONS**. Much of
> the Windows work already done is **shared engine work** (comment shaping,
> Cantonese goldens, the cross-platform baseline fix) and stays; only the
> Windows-*platform*-specific pieces wait their turn.

### Post-M9 TypeDuck-Web hardening *(completed 2026-06-18)*

Build-out is done — WASM/Emscripten export contract for the `yune_typeduck_*`
adapter, TypeScript bridge/runtime package, browser filesystem + IDBFS
persistence, and an app-shaped E2E seam against upstream TypeDuck-Web. The
Emscripten build now emits loadable `yune-typeduck.js`/`.wasm` glue, and a Node
smoke instantiates it, calls a `yune_typeduck_*` export, and performs an
Emscripten `FS` write/read. The TypeDuck-Web adapter now maps runtime
`candidate.text`, `candidate.comment`, and `context.highlighted` into the
upstream candidate panel shape with a focused mapper smoke. The patched
TypeDuck-Web worker now calls the modular Emscripten factory, mounts IDBFS,
fetches real `public/schema` assets before init, and participates in the real
browser run. HR-1 through HR-4 cleared real-asset loading, startup `setOption`,
deploy, and live persistence/reload. HR-5 reran the full browser matrix against
real TypeDuck assets with zero warning/error console entries. HR-6 covered the
shared reverse-lookup joiner and schema-prompt oracle cases. The current
recommendation is **GO WITH CONDITIONS** for AI-native frontend exposure.

**Validation plan:** [`plans/typeduck-web-validation-plan.md`](./plans/typeduck-web-validation-plan.md) — complete for M9; keep its evidence gates green.
Detail: [`plans/typeduck-web-adapter.md`](./plans/typeduck-web-adapter.md), [`plans/typeduck-web-integration-findings.md`](./plans/typeduck-web-integration-findings.md), [`plans/archive/ai-native-frontend-readiness.md`](./plans/archive/ai-native-frontend-readiness.md) (HR-7 recommendation).

### M10: TypeDuck-Windows native backend *(started early; platform work deferred)*

TypeDuck-Windows (a weasel fork) talks only to the RIME C ABI, so swapping
`librime → Yune` is contained **iff** Yune presents the same ABI surface and
emits the same candidate data. The contract is in
[`typeduck-windows-backend-requirements.md`](./typeduck-windows-backend-requirements.md);
the implementation plan and its execution notes are in
[`plans/yune-windows-contract-implementation-plan.md`](./plans/yune-windows-contract-implementation-plan.md).
A first pass already landed. Now that M9 browser validation is complete, the
platform-specific Windows package and real TypeDuck-Windows E2E can resume. The
remaining shared Cantonese parity captures continue to benefit both web and
Windows.

**Status** (workspace tests green and clippy clean, independently verified):

| # | Contract item | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Windows test baseline | ✅ Done | Was 233 failing (timestamp-shape mismatch poisoning a shared test lock); fixed with a cross-platform ctime formatter + poison-tolerant lock. |
| 1 | `config_list_append_{string,bool,int,double}` C ABI | ✅ Done | Implemented with create-on-missing semantics, wired into the `RimeApi` table; field order **verified to match the fork's `rime_api.h`** (right after `config_list_size`). |
| 2 | `RimeCandidate.comment` fork shaping | ✅ Covered for current v1.1.2 slices | `dictionary_lookup_filter` emits the `\f\r1,…\r0,…` panel format; HR-5 byte-asserts dictionary-panel comments against the v1.1.2 fixture, and HR-6 locks the `"; "` reverse-lookup join plus schema-name prompt/preedit bytes against a dedicated v1.1.2 oracle fixture. |
| 3 | Cantonese/Jyutping parity suite vs v1.1.2 | 🟡 Partial | 4 active golden-locked tests; 5 behaviors (`combine_candidates`/`show_full_code`/`enable_sentence`, completion/prediction, correction, schema-menu hiding, userdb pronunciations) are honestly `#[ignore]`d pending captured goldens. |
| 4 | Native `rime.dll` + `.lib` + headers | 🟡 Scripted, unverified | `scripts/package-typeduck-windows.ps1` + [`plans/yune-windows-native-build.md`](./plans/yune-windows-native-build.md) build/package/smoke-check the artifact, but the build has not been independently verified on an MSVC host. |

The v1.1.2 oracle fixture used for items 2–3 is **genuine captured fork output**
(`crates/yune-core/tests/fixtures/typeduck-v1.1.2/`).

### M11: AI-native input layer *(S1-S4 CLI/core slices complete; remaining gates pending)*

The first AI-native slice is implemented only in `crates/yune-core` and the
direct `yune-cli run` path, keeping M9/M10 frontend surfaces unchanged. The core
now exposes an `AiCandidateProvider` interface, deterministic `MockAiProvider`,
and `AiWorker`; provider execution is CLI-orchestrated outside
`Engine::refresh_candidates`, and the engine consumes only staged,
input-keyed results. Matching AI candidates append after classic candidates, so
the top classic candidate stays pinned. S2 adds structured AI source metadata
with fixed-point confidence and orders AI rows by confidence after classic rows.

Safety gates from S1/S2 are in place: default Space/Return confirmation rejects
highlighted AI candidates, explicit AI selection does not stage librime userdb
learning, keyed pending/ready results prevent stale AI state from applying to a
different input, and the direct CLI transcript records a deterministic
`ai_decision` when the mock path is enabled. Focused `yune-core`/`yune-cli`
tests are green. S3 adds explicit AI context snapshots and a default-sensitive
privacy policy that blocks remote providers before invocation and exposes the
future memory-learning gate. S4 adds an inspectable, clearable, disable-able
`MemoryStore` for explicit AI selections, suppresses writes in sensitive
contexts, and gives persistence hosts `.ai-memory` names instead of librime
`*.userdb` names. Local-model providers and real frontend exposure remain later
M11 gates.

---

## Next

Concrete, in priority order (**web first, then Windows, then other platforms**):

1. **Keep the M9 web gates green on merge.** Preserve the reproducible Emscripten build, TypeScript runtime tests/build, TypeDuck-Web worker build, real-assets browser evidence, and native `typeduck_web` fallback.
2. **Capture the remaining shared Cantonese goldens.** Five fork-specific cases remain explicit ignored blockers pending TypeDuck v1.1.2 oracle captures: option-combination behavior, completion/prediction, correction, schema-menu hiding, and per-entry userdb pronunciations.
3. **Resume Windows, then other platforms.** Verify the native `rime.dll`/`.lib`/headers build on an MSVC host, including `rime_get_api`/`config_list_append_string` smoke and header field-order parity, then run the real TypeDuck-Windows E2E per the fork's `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`. Other native frontends follow the same engine.
4. **Continue M11 beyond the S1-S4 CLI/core slices.** The M9 verdict permits real-frontend exposure only with AI default-off until the remaining local-model gate is proven.

---

## Deferred / future

- **librime C++ plugin ABI** (Lua, octagram, predict, proto): deferred until a concrete frontend or distribution requires it; prefer Yune-native extension points first.
- **AI-native input layer (M11 later slices)** — after the completed S1-S4 CLI/core mock/provider, worker/confidence, context/privacy, and memory slices, remaining work covers local-model providers and eventual real-frontend exposure behind explicit defaults. The architecture remains in [`plans/ai-native-design.md`](./plans/ai-native-design.md); S1 evidence and checklist live in [`plans/ai-native-cli-slice-plan.md`](./plans/ai-native-cli-slice-plan.md).

## Principles (carried forward)

- **Oracle, not template.** Treat librime as the behavior oracle, but prefer idiomatic Rust, cleaner abstractions, stronger typing, and deterministic tests over cloning librime's internal C++ structure.
- **Name the behavior.** Before adding a librime-derived mechanism, name the external behavior it protects (user-visible input, frontend ABI, schema/config semantics, or deployed-data compatibility). If it's only an internal librime detail, use a smaller Yune-native design, isolate it behind an adapter, or document a deferral.
- **Own each slice.** Choose the owning implementation module, matching test module, and librime comparison target before writing a compatibility slice. Keep `lib.rs`/`main.rs` as facades.
