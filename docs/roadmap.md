# Roadmap

Yune is a Rust input-method engine that uses **librime as a compatibility
oracle** while building toward an AI-native input engine librime cannot provide.
The strategy: make existing RIME schemas and frontends behave predictably through
Yune, measuring every difference against librime before accepting it, then layer
AI-native behavior on top as a separate product milestone.

> **Compatibility oracle.** Upstream librime latest stable is the default core
> behavior reference for user-visible behavior, schema semantics, standard ABI
> contracts, deployed data, and migration. The current pinned upstream target is
> `rime/librime 1.17.0`
> (`33e78140250125871856cdc5b42ddc6a5fcd3cd4`):
> <https://github.com/rime/librime>. TypeDuck-specific behavior is referenced
> only as a compatibility profile against the TypeDuck fork (tag `v1.1.2`,
> commit `74cb52b78fb2411137a7643f6c8bc6517acfde69`):
> <https://github.com/TypeDuck-HK/librime>. (Earlier docs referenced a local
> checkout path; treat the GitHub sources above as canonical.)

## Compatibility goal — oracle as a floor, not a feature checklist

Yune treats librime as a **behavioral oracle, not a feature target.** Success is
**not** "reimplement 100% of librime 1.17.0" — that would contradict the standing
*"oracle, not template"* principle and add no product value, since librime
already exists. Success is that **the schemas and frontends Yune targets behave
correctly against the oracle**, every difference measured and either fixed or
documented, with the **AI-native layer librime cannot provide** riding on top of
that compatible base.

The goal has two horizons and one explicit non-goal:

- **(A) Target-driven compatibility — the near-term definition of "done."** A
  bounded, *named* set of schemas and frontends must behave correctly versus the
  oracle. Today that set is the `luna_pinyin` core path (vs the upstream `1.17.0`
  oracle) and the TypeDuck `jyut6ping3` profile (vs the `v1.1.2` oracle). "Done"
  is always relative to this named list — never an open-ended checklist. This is
  what M12 begins.
- **(B) Broad RIME compatibility — the expansion ambition.** Over time, widen the
  named set so the **common** RIME schemas and the **real third-party frontends**
  (ibus / fcitx / Squirrel / weasel, TypeDuck-Web / Windows) work predictably.
  Breadth is added schema-by-schema and frontend-by-frontend through the same
  oracle-measured parity harness — not in one leap, and not by cloning librime
  wholesale.
- **Non-goal: bit-for-bit feature parity with librime internals.** Reproducing
  every librime gear, plugin, and code path is out of scope. A librime feature is
  implemented only when a named (A)/(B) target needs it (*"name the behavior"*).

So **"the engine is done" is never absolute** — it reads *"the current target set
is green against the oracle; everything else is deferred-and-documented."* The
product north star is the AI-native layer on top of a compatible base, not parity
for its own sake. *(Ratified as a standing principle and `D-25` in
[`decisions.md`](./decisions.md#standing-principles).)*

## Completed

### M0–M4: Foundation
- Rust workspace (`yune-core`, `yune-rime-api`, `yune-cli`; the early orphaned `yune-schema` crate was removed in M23); core session/candidate types; CLI smoke test.
- Deterministic compatibility harness: recorded fixtures, JSON output for context/candidates/commit/status, workspace tests.
- RIME-style schema subset: processors, segmentors, translators, filters as named components; config patch/include behavior.
- Table dictionary prototype with deterministic lookup and ranking.
- Non-blocking candidate reranking trait with a mock ranker; classic ordering preserved as fallback.

### M5–M7: RIME ABI, schema, and data compatibility
- Focused RIME-style C ABI (`yune-rime-api`): sessions, context/status/commit, config, levers, schema lists, deployment, modules, runtime options, key processing — driven through the exported `RimeApi` function table.
- Broad librime-compatible key-table coverage and aligned core/ABI key handling.
- Schema-loaded compatibility across the high-value processor/segmentor/translator/filter set (speller, editor, navigator, selector, chord, punctuation, shape; abc/ascii/affix/matcher segmentors; table/script/r10n/reverse-lookup/history/switch/schema-list translators; simplifier/uniquifier/charset/reverse-lookup filters).
- Source `.dict.yaml` parsing aligned with librime/yaml-cpp edge cases; `import_tables`; preset vocabulary; table-encoder primitives; checksum/rebuild-plan groundwork.
- Compiled `.table.bin`/`.prism.bin`/`.reverse.bin` payload consumption and rebuild execution; correction/tolerance data in the compiled path.
- UserDB compatibility beyond the plain-text shim: storage, snapshot/restore/recovery/sync, transaction rollback, learning, frequency updates, predictive lookup.

Detail: [`plans/archive/m05-m07-record-compat-foundation-summary.md`](./plans/archive/m05-m07-record-compat-foundation-summary.md), [`plans/archive/m05-m07-record-foundation-refactor.md`](./plans/archive/m05-m07-record-foundation-refactor.md) (module/test ownership rules), and the [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md) log.

### M8: Real frontend validation & benchmarks
- Host-shaped native loader validates the full `rime_get_api` → setup → deploy → schema select → session → key process → context/status → commit → teardown lifecycle.
- Squirrel/macOS and ibus/fcitx Linux paths attempted and documented with reproducible blockers (not claimed as completed native integration).
- Frontend-sensitive benchmark baselines for session lifecycle, per-key processing, deploy/dictionary loading, and userdb learning/sync.
- **Outcome:** *GO WITH CONDITIONS* to begin AI-native candidate/ranking **design**.

Detail: [`plans/archive/m08-plan-real-frontend-validation.md`](./plans/archive/m08-plan-real-frontend-validation.md), [`plans/archive/frontend-validation/`](./plans/archive/frontend-validation/).

### M9: TypeDuck-Web browser validation

- Emscripten build emits loadable `yune-typeduck.js`/`.wasm` glue, and a Node
  smoke instantiates it, calls a `yune_typeduck_*` export, and performs an
  Emscripten `FS` write/read.
- TypeDuck-Web adapter maps runtime `candidate.text`, `candidate.comment`, and
  `context.highlighted` into the upstream candidate panel shape.
- Patched TypeDuck-Web worker calls the modular Emscripten factory, mounts IDBFS,
  fetches real `public/schema` assets before init, and runs in a real browser.
- **Browser result:** the HR-5 real-assets matrix passes for composition,
  candidate list, paging, selection, deletion, Space commit, phrase commit,
  deploy, customize, persistence sync, reload survival, and dictionary-panel
  rendering against `jyut6ping3_mobile`; the committed byte-parity guarantee
  for rich dictionary comments is the `cantonese_parity` fixture, with the
  browser-shaped native rich-comment test enabled when local v1.1.2 oracle
  build assets are present. HR-6 also locks the shared reverse-lookup `"; "`
  joiner and schema-prompt bytes against the TypeDuck v1.1.2 oracle.
- **Outcome:** **GO WITH CONDITIONS** for AI-native frontend exposure. This
  supersedes the old tooling-blocked Phase 10 NO-GO and the interim hardening
  NO-GO: real browser compatibility is proven, but AI-native behavior remains
  disabled by default in real frontends until the M11 provider/ranking/privacy
  contracts are proven and explicitly enabled.

Detail: [`plans/archive/m09-plan-typeduck-web-validation.md`](./plans/archive/m09-plan-typeduck-web-validation.md), [`plans/m09-reference-typeduck-web-adapter.md`](./plans/m09-reference-typeduck-web-adapter.md), [`plans/archive/m09-findings-typeduck-web-integration.md`](./plans/archive/m09-findings-typeduck-web-integration.md), [`plans/archive/m09-record-ai-native-frontend-readiness.md`](./plans/archive/m09-record-ai-native-frontend-readiness.md) (HR-7 recommendation).

### M11: AI-native input layer — S1–S5 CLI/core complete *(2026-06-18; frontend exposure deferred)*

The AI-native layer (M11) is implemented in `crates/yune-core` and the direct
`yune-cli run` path only, leaving the TypeDuck-Web and TypeDuck-Windows frontend surfaces unchanged. The
core exposes an `AiCandidateProvider` interface, deterministic `MockAiProvider`,
and an `AiWorker` (provider execution is CLI-orchestrated outside
`Engine::refresh_candidates`; the engine consumes only staged, input-keyed
results); structured `Ai { provider, confidence }` source metadata with
fixed-point confidence; one merge function that pins the top classic candidate
at index 0; a default-sensitive `AiPrivacyPolicy` that blocks remote providers
before invocation and gates learning; an inspectable / clearable / disable-able
`MemoryStore` kept **outside** the librime `*.userdb` namespace; and a
deterministic local rule-backed provider (`yune-cli run --ai-provider local`).
All eight S1–S5 safety criteria are independently verified — source-labeled,
classic-first, non-blocking, no default auto-commit, **no userdb leak**,
privacy-gated, deterministic fallback. Real frontend exposure remains deferred
and default-off (see *Deferred / future*).

### M12: Upstream behavioral parity closeout (upstream `1.17.0`)

Yune's core engine now tracks upstream `rime/librime 1.17.0` as the default
oracle target. M12 turned TypeDuck behavior into an explicit compatibility
profile instead of the default engine truth. The expanded M12 closeout captures
`luna_pinyin` behavior from the official upstream Windows MSVC release binary
and checks Yune against those bytes for curated single-code mechanics, full
`ni` dictionary selection with essay weights, Engine paging/selection/commit,
reverse lookup, punctuation/symbol candidates, and supported option paths
(`zh_hans` single-code conversion and full-shape punctuation first candidate).
The later M17 and M18 milestones closed the `zhongguo` sentence/lattice,
`ascii_punct` processor bypass, and punctuation immediate-commit blockers with
fresh upstream fixtures instead of retroactively expanding M12.

Detail: [`plans/archive/m12-plan-upstream-oracle-refresh.md`](./plans/archive/m12-plan-upstream-oracle-refresh.md) and [`plans/archive/m12-plan-upstream-behavioral-parity-closeout.md`](./plans/archive/m12-plan-upstream-behavioral-parity-closeout.md).

**Status**:

| # | Work item | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Pin upstream oracle | Done | Upstream `1.17.0` commit `33e78140250125871856cdc5b42ddc6a5fcd3cd4` is the default core target; provenance is checked in and the official Windows MSVC release binary is available for behavioral byte capture. |
| 1 | Fixture naming policy | Done | Fixture manifests and the provenance guard test distinguish `upstream-1.17.0` from `typeduck-v1.1.2`. |
| 2 | TypeDuck assumption audit | Done | Existing TypeDuck-derived behavior is classified in `docs/plans/archive/m12-audit-coverage.md`. |
| 3 | First upstream parity slice | Done | Default `RimeApi` ABI parity was refreshed to `rime/librime 1.17.0`; fork-only `start_quick` and `config_list_append_*` slots are excluded from the core table. |
| 4 | First upstream behavioral fixture | Done | `luna-pinyin-basic.json` is captured from the official upstream `1.17.0` binary and checked by `upstream_luna_pinyin_parity`. |
| 5 | Expanded upstream behavioral fixtures | Done | `luna-pinyin-selection`, `actions`, `reverse-lookup`, `punctuation`, and `options` fixtures are captured from the official release binary with provenance enforced by `oracle_fixture_provenance`. |
| 6 | Full-pipeline parity gates | Done | Active `upstream_luna_pinyin_parity` coverage drives Yune's real parser, dictionary, translator, filter, and Engine paths; later M17/M18 fixtures closed the formerly ignored sentence/lattice and processor blockers. |

### M13: AI-native frontend exposure

The first test of the product thesis: take M11's completed CLI/core AI layer to a
**real frontend** — default-off, local-first, and gated by the same safety
invariants already proven in the CLI. M11 owns the hard parts (the
`AiCandidateProvider` trait, `MockAiProvider`/`LocalModelProvider`, the
input-keyed merge that pins the top classic candidate at index 0, the
default-sensitive `AiPrivacyPolicy`, and the `MemoryStore` kept outside the
librime `*.userdb` namespace). M13 carries that surface — **unchanged and still
safe** — across the frontend boundary on **TypeDuck-Web**, the only
GO-WITH-CONDITIONS frontend (M9). No core or TypeDuck compatibility behavior
changes.

**Orchestration decision.** M11 requires the per-key path to *never* run provider
code — it only reads an already-staged result. The browser has no CLI host, and
`AiWorker` uses `std::thread`, which does not port to Emscripten. M13 honors the
invariant with **two passes in Rust**: `yune_typeduck_process_key` stays
unchanged and returns the classic response (so AI-off is byte-identical and the
key path never invokes the provider); a new `yune_typeduck_stage_ai` export then
runs the `LocalModelProvider` **synchronously** and stages an input-keyed result,
which the worker requests **after** rendering classic. Classic input is never
delayed; AI rows arrive as a bounded **second-pass update** on the
off-main-thread worker. The async / second-Web-Worker port is deferred.

**Non-goals (deferred).** Remote LLM providers; the async background-worker port;
exposure through Windows or other native frontends; any change to classic-input
defaults.

**Status**:

| # | Work item | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Browser AI orchestration | Done | `process_key` stays provider-free; `yune_typeduck_stage_ai` runs the `LocalModelProvider` in Rust as a second pass after classic renders. |
| 1 | Default-off + opt-in toggle | Done | AI is invisible until enabled; disabling AI clears staged rows for the current input so the visible candidate page returns to classic output. |
| 2 | Source-labeled candidates in the panel | Done | AI rows render after the classic top candidate with `source: "ai:local"` from engine snapshot data aligned to the rendered page; `RimeCandidate` remains unchanged. |
| 3 | Commit-boundary safety in the browser | Done | Space/Return/default commits classic; explicit AI selection never writes librime userdb, and sensitive-default browser context suppresses AI-memory learning. |
| 4 | Privacy in browser context | Done | Browser context has no app/field signal and defaults to **sensitive**; M13 ships local only and keeps remote providers out of scope. |
| 5 | Browser-E2E safety evidence | Done | Native `typeduck_web`, TS runtime tests/build, and the real TypeDuck-Web Playwright M13 scenarios cover AI-off identity, AI labels, no auto-commit, and explicit AI selection. |

**Outcome:** M13 proves the web surface of the product thesis. The M11 safety
invariants (classic-first, non-blocking classic path, no default AI auto-commit,
no userdb leak, privacy-gated local provider, deterministic fallback) now hold
through TypeDuck-Web. AI candidates render as a second-pass update, are labeled,
and never preempt classic index 0. Classic input remains byte-identical with AI
off, and disabling AI clears stale staged rows for the current input. This
supersedes the *Deferred / future* "AI-native frontend exposure" item for the web
surface only; native frontend exposure remains deferred.

### M14–M16: TypeDuck-Web fork parity

The chosen next arc: complete the **TypeDuck `jyut6ping3` target** so the
TypeDuck-Web example behaves like the fork — the named (A) target from the
*Compatibility goal*, not feature-completeness for its own sake. **Key gap-map
finding:** `jyut6ping3` is dictionary-driven (`script_translator` +
`dictionary_lookup_filter` + `simplifier`); it does **not** use
`poet`/`octagram`/grammar, so this arc needs **golden capture + dictionary-driven
features**, *not* the upstream language model (that is Track 2 / M17). Five
behaviors are fixture-backed in `cantonese_parity.rs`, with browser-only gaps
listed explicitly below.

#### M14 — Capture the TypeDuck v1.1.2 Cantonese goldens

Parameterize the scenario-capable `oracle-rime-probe.cs` (its traits currently
hardcode upstream `1.17.0` identity) — or add a TypeDuck v1.1.2 capture wrapper —
with the **correct v1.1.2 oracle identity** (modules, distribution name/version,
provenance) and a `jyut6ping3` fixture composer, then capture goldens from the
v1.1.2 oracle binary (oracle-measured, non-circular).

| # | Work item | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | v1.1.2 capture wrapper | Done | `oracle-rime-probe.cs` has TypeDuck v1.1.2 identity support and `scripts/capture-typeduck-jyutping.ps1` composes provenance-stamped fixtures. |
| 1 | Option-toggle goldens | Done | `jyut6ping3-m14-options.json` captures deploy-time variants for `combine_candidates`, `show_full_code`, and `enable_sentence` at multiple input lengths. |
| 2 | Completion + correction goldens | Done | `jyut6ping3-m14-completion-correction.json` captures completion and correction variants, including the `nri` correction difference. |
| 3 | Schema-menu goldens | Done | `jyut6ping3-m14-schema-menu.json` captures the emitted `RimeGetSchemaList` one-schema vs multi-schema surface; `hide_lone_schema` / `hide_caret` UI decoration is deferred to the M16 browser assertion. |
| 4 | userdb-pronunciation **feasibility spike** | Done | `jyut6ping3-m14-userdb.json` proves levers export is available and captures a learned `nei5` userdb row. |

#### M15 — Dictionary-driven feature parity

Complete. Yune's real engine now passes the M14 dictionary-driven goldens without
adding a language model or changing the upstream ABI.

| # | Work item | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `combine_candidates` | Done | Same-text rows coalesce with multi-primary TypeDuck dictionary comments when `translator/combine_candidates` is enabled; separate mode remains available. |
| 1 | `show_full_code` | Done | Affix-aware table lookup and cangjie short/full-code comments match the M14 side-lookup fixture. |
| 2 | `enable_sentence` | Done | Viterbi dictionary sentence candidates plus sentence-aware lookup comments reproduce the `ngohaigo` M14 row. |
| 3 | completion + correction | Done | Completion/correction fixture paths are active in `cantonese_parity`; correction uses the real spelling-algebra path. |
| 4 | OpenCC `hk2s` data | Done | `SimplifierFilter` now loads checked-in OpenCC source dictionaries for the `hk2s` chain instead of a hardcoded char slice. |

#### M16 — TypeDuck-Web fork-parity validation

Complete with documented browser-surface limits. The real TypeDuck-Web Playwright
matrix now covers the browser-supported `jyut6ping3_mobile` surface against the
M14 goldens where the app exposes it: default combined candidates, sentence
composition, completion, simplification, the existing M9 smoke flows, and the
M13 default-off AI scenarios. M15 remains the authoritative real-engine proof
for deploy-only variants (`common:/separate_candidates`, `common:/show_full_code`)
and correction details that TypeDuck-Web does not expose as independent browser
selectors. Schema-menu hiding and per-entry userdb pronunciation remain explicit
browser/userdb inspection gaps, backed by the M14 emitted-schema-list and levers
export fixtures rather than claimed as browser UI coverage.

> **Scope of M14–M16, and what it did *not* cover.** M14–M16 closed the *captured*

> (1) **F2 (`santai`→身體/身體健康 prefix prediction) and F4 (auto-compose-only-as-fallback)

> upstream, not by porting fork code; only the fork's *prediction ranking* differs.
> (2) **The Cantonese 容錯 (fuzzy) ruleset was previously stripped on dictionaries >50k
> entries** (`schema_install.rs:237-260`); the production `jyut6ping3_scolar` dict is
> ~127k rows, so this became the highest-priority TypeDuck Cantonese engine-parity
> backlog item and is now covered by a real-dictionary golden.
>
> **Backlog closeout:** FORK-PARITY-01..09 are now implemented or explicitly decided.
> F08 keeps upstream `1.17.0` ranking semantics while preserving long-entry prediction
> and adding profile controls for prediction thresholds / never-first behavior. F09 is
> intentionally UI-side for TypeDuck-Web display-language selection.

### M20: Web demo showcase controls

M20 turned this repo's patched TypeDuck-Web harness into Yune's canonical
internal browser playground for demoing, stress-testing, and comparing the
behavior already proven by M9, M13, M14-M16, and the FORK-PARITY backlog. It is a
**separate web/demo track**,
not a reopened M13: M13 remains the completed default-off AI frontend exposure
milestone, while M20 made the browser demo highly controllable, honest,
inspectable, and useful for manual dogfooding before later M17 and frontend work.

This is not the same surface as a separately cloned `TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Web`
product checkout. `packages/yune-typeduck-runtime/` remains the reusable Yune
runtime bridge, `third_party/typeduck-web/` is the internal patched harness, and
the real TypeDuck-Web web IME product should get its own future integration
track.

The milestone exposes only controls backed by real runtime behavior:
schema/deploy-time knobs through `customize()` (`enable_completion`,
`enable_correction`, `enable_sentence`, learning, `combine_candidates`,
`prediction_never_first`, and one measured, fine-grained prediction threshold
with a real-assets-calibrated `santai` cutoff and documented range bounds) and
live session options through `setOption()` (`ascii_mode`, `full_shape`,
`simplification`). Browser-visible controls have before/after assertions,
including learned prediction ranking for `prediction_never_first`; Input Memory
records a visible learned-prediction on-state but an explicit browser-surface
N/A for memory-off suppression, and Auto-correction records real `nri`
browser before/after evidence: correction off renders the v1.1.2 prefix
fallback page and correction on renders `你` first, while `cantonese_parity`
continues to lock the full oracle row set and commit previews. Deploy-time
controls whose current
browser panel effect is not independently visible keep persisted
`jyut6ping3_mobile.custom.yaml` assertions, without being counted as
candidate-output proof. Display-only controls are grouped separately and prove
visible rendering changes for the current browser-reachable display surface.
Static or
default-on engine features such as `santai`
-> `身體健康`, Cantonese fuzzy/容錯, letter-to-tone input, reverse lookup,
`show_full_code` reachability/N-A, and AI second-pass behavior are presented as
guided scenarios rather than fake toggles. The M20 UI keeps grouped candidates
as a documented demo default, while the checked-in raw mobile assets still
record the `common:/separate_candidates` patch. For the current
`jyut6ping3_mobile` browser schema, reverse/Cangjie/show-full-code evidence
records the missing `cangjie` namespace as N/A instead of exposing a fake
control. `ascii_punct` now has M18 core/ABI processor behavior, but the browser
playground should expose it only after a dedicated browser-visible M22 evidence
slice proves the control honestly changes observable output.
As Yune adds browser-safe engine features, this playground should gain either an
active control or a guided scenario so the web surface stays useful for future
regression hunts and product demos.

Evidence lives under
`third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m20-showcase-controls/`. The completed
plan is archived at
[`plans/archive/m20-plan-web-demo-showcase-controls.md`](./plans/archive/m20-plan-web-demo-showcase-controls.md).

### M21: TypeDuck-Web product comparison closeout

M21 compared the internal Yune TypeDuck-Web harness against the deployed
`typeduck.hk/web` product as a qualitative feel target while keeping the pinned
TypeDuck v1.1.2 fixtures as the only hard oracle. The final gap ledger has no
remaining hard-oracle action rows: every row is now classified as a v1.1.2 match,
an oracle-backed fix, expected version skew, or current browser-surface N/A.

Three oracle-backed slices closed during M21:

- **M21-GAP-01:** multi-syllable dictionary sentence composition now matches the
  v1.1.2 fixture for `loengnincin`, `leoicijyu`, `ngohaigo`, and analogous
  cases, with the sentence word penalty documented as a Yune heuristic validated
  against that fixture.
- **M21-GAP-02:** `nri` partial-parse prefix fallback and the TypeDuck
  `jyut6ping3` prediction-count behavior now match v1.1.2, with browser
  before/after evidence replacing the old auto-correction N/A.
- **Closeout fixture:** `jyut6ping3-m21-closeout.json` locks the remaining
  baseline, fuzzy, sentence, `hk2s`, tone-letter, and paging rows, including the
  final standalone-`m` and `mgoi` abbreviation/fuzzy ordering fixes.

Live product differences such as `leoicijyu` (`類似於` live vs `類似如` in
v1.1.2) and `seov` (`eo`/`oe` fuzzy version skew) are recorded as
expected-by-design unless a future pinned oracle fixture says otherwise.

Detail: [`plans/m21-plan-typeduck-web-product-comparison.md`](./plans/m21-plan-typeduck-web-product-comparison.md)
and
[`third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m21-product-comparison/2026-06-20T0849Z-yune-cdb7bd52-product-manual/gap-ledger.md`](../third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m21-product-comparison/2026-06-20T0849Z-yune-cdb7bd52-product-manual/gap-ledger.md).

### M23: Architecture hardening

M23 closed the bounded architecture-hardening register without doing the larger
trigger-gated processor extraction. The TypeDuck-calibrated `21.0` sentence word
penalty is now a typed translator setting defaulting to upstream-neutral behavior
and installed only for the `jyut6ping3` TypeDuck profile; default upstream
schemas such as `luna_pinyin` no longer inherit it. The correction constants were
audited and remain unreachable from default upstream schemas because correction
is opt-in and dynamic correction lookup is already profile-gated.

The workspace lint policy now applies to the unsafe-free core crate, while
`yune-rime-api` and the ABI-driving `yune-cli` have explicit non-inheriting FFI
lint exceptions. M23 also removed the orphaned `yune-schema` crate instead of
parking it; production schema parsing/install remains in `yune-rime-api`.
Finally, the inline core facade tests and oversized ABI test modules were split
into behavior-owned include files with unchanged test names.

[`plans/archive/m23-plan-architecture-hardening.md`](./plans/archive/m23-plan-architecture-hardening.md).

### M18: Deployment & processor depth

M18 turned the dictionary subsystem from read/plan-only into read/write for the
named Yune artifact surface. `yune-core` now has pure-Rust Darts double-array
support, parses real upstream prism double-array sections, builds
`build_table_bin` / `build_reverse_bin` / `build_prism_bin`, and exposes
`execute_rebuild_plan` so a rebuild plan can write exactly the artifacts it marks
rebuilt. The RIME deployer path now delegates to those public writers instead of
private placeholder serializers; generated table/reverse artifacts round-trip
through the existing readers, and generated prism artifacts include a real
double-array spelling index.

M18 also closed the M12/M20 punctuation processor blockers without changing
`RimeApi`, candidate ABI, or TypeDuck profile ABI. A new upstream 1.17.0
curated punctuation fixture proves `ascii_punct` returns upstream no-op for
configured punctuation keys, `{commit: ...}` commits immediately, scalar
punctuation creates confirm-unique preview state, pair punctuation alternates
preview text, and list punctuation cycles the selected candidate. The former
ignored core parity blockers are now active, and the ABI processor follows the
same behavior. The upstream prism fixture
`m18-luna-pinyin-prism.bin` proves Yune parses a real librime Darts section; the
punctuation fixture is captured by `scripts/capture-upstream-m18-punctuation.ps1`.

The completed plan is archived at
[`plans/archive/m18-plan-deployment-and-processor-depth.md`](./plans/archive/m18-plan-deployment-and-processor-depth.md).

### M22: Web playground feature-completeness

M22 is complete. The internal TypeDuck-Web playground now keeps the Bucket 2
read-only inspector off by default and identity-preserving, and it completes the
remaining playground buckets without changing the default `RimeApi` table,
`RimeCandidate`, or ABI layout files.

Bucket 1 exposes only browser-honest controls: `dictionary_exclude` is a
deploy-time customization with persisted-config and candidate-removal evidence;
`extended_charset` changes the Cangjie candidate set through the installed
charset filter; `traditionalization` and `disabled` are live session controls
with visible status output. `ascii_punct` is still absent from the playground
because no fresh browser-visible before/after evidence was captured for it.

Bucket 3 loads `jyut6ping3_mobile`, `cangjie5`, and `luna_pinyin` through a real
schema switcher. The new Cangjie and Luna browser schemas use M18/M19-derived
schema data and compiled artifacts under the TypeDuck-Web app's
`source/public/schema` asset tree; the measured M22 compiled browser assets are:
`cangjie5.table.bin` 1,509,778 bytes, `cangjie5.prism.bin` 1,430,557 bytes,
`cangjie5.reverse.bin` 663,901 bytes, `luna_pinyin.table.bin` 613,855 bytes,
`luna_pinyin.prism.bin` 23,465 bytes, and `luna_pinyin.reverse.bin` 704,357
bytes. Reverse lookup is active for both new schemas.

Evidence is committed under
`third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m22-remaining-buckets/`. The completed
plan is archived at
[`plans/archive/m22-plan-web-playground-multischema-inspector.md`](./plans/archive/m22-plan-web-playground-multischema-inspector.md).

### M19: Breadth schemas and TypeDuck-profile ABI surface

M19 added three upstream `1.17.0` schema families to Yune's named compatibility
set without widening the default TypeDuck profile. `double_pinyin`, `cangjie5`,
and `bopomofo` now each have a provenance-stamped upstream oracle fixture, an
owning parity test, and source-policy checks in `oracle_fixture_provenance.rs`.
The active captured cases cover Shuangpin spelling-algebra folding, Cangjie
exact-code table lookups, and Zhuyin keymap/tone algebra. Sentence/lattice
behavior, broader Cangjie phrase/table-encoder interleave, and schema-speller
digit/space key routing remain explicit ignored blockers instead of hidden
claims.

M19 also named the TypeDuck profile ABI surface for the parked Windows backend:
`rime_get_typeduck_profile_api()` exposes the fork-only
`config_list_append_{bool,int,double,string}` slots through a non-default
profile table, while the default `rime_get_api()` table remains upstream
`1.17.0` shaped. The new reference doc records the slot surface and explicitly
keeps `start_quick`, Windows packaging, and real TypeDuck-Windows frontend E2E
out of M19.

The completed plan is archived at
[`plans/archive/m19-plan-breadth-schemas.md`](./plans/archive/m19-plan-breadth-schemas.md).

## Parked

### M10: TypeDuck-Windows native backend

TypeDuck-Windows remains valuable, but it is no longer the active core-engine
priority. Its work is parked as a TypeDuck compatibility profile. M19 named the
ABI surface for the fork-only list-append slots, and the M10 resume now has a
current TypeDuck-profile package/header smoke plus packaged host-loader
lifecycle evidence. The real TypeDuck-Windows build/link and frontend smoke are
still blocked in this environment.

Archived pre-M12 M10 evidence is preserved: Windows test trust, fork-only
`config_list_append_*` helper behavior, current TypeDuck comment shaping
fixtures, and a historical native `rime.dll`/`.lib`/headers package smoke. That
package smoke is not an active or valid gate for the default upstream
`rime_get_api()` table after M12. Current package evidence uses an
upstream-shaped default `rime_api.h` plus `rime_typeduck_profile_api.h`,
packages upstream-deprecated direct-call declarations for the existing
TypeDuck-Windows source, loads the packaged DLL, resolves
`rime_get_typeduck_profile_api()`, verifies the profile append slots, and runs
the dynamic-loader lifecycle. Remaining TypeDuck-Windows work is blocked by
T1/T3: Visual Studio 2022 Community and MSBuild are installed, and the pinned
TypeDuck-Windows checkout now reaches x64 compilation against the Yune package
plus local Boost. The rime-facing `RimeWithWeasel` static-library target
compiles with project references disabled, but the full frontend build still
requires missing ATL/MFC headers (`atlbase.h`, `afxres.h`) and the deployer
settings path still needs to call the named profile accessor for
`config_list_append_*`. The real TypeDuck-Windows binary therefore still has
not built/linked against the Yune package and no real frontend smoke has run.

Detail: [`typeduck-windows-backend-requirements.md`](./typeduck-windows-backend-requirements.md),
[`plans/m10-reference-typeduck-windows-contract.md`](./plans/m10-reference-typeduck-windows-contract.md),
and [`plans/m10-reference-typeduck-windows-native-build.md`](./plans/m10-reference-typeduck-windows-native-build.md).

## Concrete next steps

In priority order:

1. **Preserve the upstream-first baseline.** Keep default `RimeApi` and core behavior aligned to upstream `1.17.0`; add new TypeDuck fork-only behavior only behind an explicit profile surface.
2. **Keep M9/M13/M16/M20 web gates green on merge.** Preserve the reproducible Emscripten build, TypeScript runtime tests/build, TypeDuck-Web worker build, real-assets browser evidence, native `typeduck_web` fallback, default-off M13 AI scenarios, and M20 showcase-control honesty checks.
3. **Keep TypeDuck profile behavior isolated after M21.** TypeDuck-tuned sentence, correction, prediction, or ranking constants must stay behind an explicit profile predicate or typed translator config, not read unconditionally by default `luna_pinyin`/upstream behavior. A `TYPEDUCK_*` constant in shared core is a merge blocker unless it is gated or renamed with upstream-oracle evidence.
4. **Keep Track 2 complete and fixture-gated.** M17's upstream `luna_pinyin` null-grammar sentence/lattice path, M18's prism/deployment/processor depth, M19's breadth schemas, and M22's playground build-out are complete. Future upstream-depth work needs a named target and fresh oracle fixtures before implementation.
5. **Extend the M20 playground only with browser-safe supported features.** Add active controls or guided scenarios for new browser-safe engine behavior, and keep unsupported behavior absent or documented instead of partially exposed.
6. **Finish TypeDuck-Windows only with a real build and frontend smoke.** The M10 resume reached T2 with a current TypeDuck-profile package/header smoke and packaged DLL lifecycle. M10 stays blocked until a Visual Studio build shell can build/link the pinned TypeDuck-Windows checkout against that package and a real frontend smoke records exact input/output evidence.
7. **Add a future TypeDuck-Web product-integration track before changing a separately cloned TypeDuck-Web product checkout.** Treat `TypeDuck-HK/TypeDuck-Web` as the dedicated web IME product, not as the M20 harness or the runtime bridge.
8. **Add a future iOS keyboard-developer track before TypeDuck iOS work starts.** Treat the Cantoboard/TypeDuck iOS build repositories as platform-integration provenance, not as engine-parity code to port. The track should define Yune-native iOS packaging, Swift/Obj-C host bindings, resource bundling, sandboxed userdb/storage, keyboard-extension lifecycle limits, and mobile-specific configuration hooks.

---

## Planned / Next up

Priority is set by what a *named* (A)/(B) target needs, not by librime's feature
list. **TypeDuck `jyut6ping3` reconciliation (M14-M16), the M20 browser
playground, M23 architecture hardening, M17 upstream sentence/lattice depth, M18
deployment/processor depth, M19 breadth schemas, and M22 playground build-out
are complete** (see *Completed* above). There is no active numbered compatibility
milestone queued; future engine-depth work is trigger-gated by named targets and
fresh oracle fixtures.

### Execution order — what to do next

This is the **authoritative sequence**; the per-milestone detail bullets below
are reference, not order. M17, M18, M19, M22, and M23 are complete. New milestone
work should start only after a plan names its target, oracle, fixtures, and
front-end or schema need.

**Trigger-gated, not scheduled:** the core/ABI **processor extraction** (move
processor semantics into `yune-core`) lands only when a real non-ABI consumer
(iOS package / Yune-native frontend) needs the full input pipeline — see
`decisions.md` D-28. Do not milestone it speculatively.

---

### Per-milestone detail

> The bullets below are reference detail. The **Execution order** above is the
> authoritative sequence (note: M18 precedes M17, despite list position here).

- **M17 — Upstream sentence / language model (poet) (complete)** — implements the upstream
  `1.17.0` statistical sentence path so `luna_pinyin` SENTENCE + full-page LATTICE
  output matches the captured oracle, with the former `zhongguo` phrase and
  full-page sentence-lattice blockers now active in `upstream_luna_pinyin_parity.rs`.
  Grounded finding that
  makes it tractable: `luna_pinyin` ships an `essay.txt` vocabulary but **no `.gram`
  model**, so the oracle's poet runs the `grammar == nullptr` branch where
  `Grammar::Evaluate` returns `entry_weight + kPenalty` with
  `kPenalty = -13.815510557964274` (`ln(1e-6)`) — a fixed per-word log-prob penalty,
  *not* a learned bigram. M17 owns a new `poet` module in `yune-core` (log-space
  Viterbi/beam DP over a dictionary `WordGraph` with that constant and `MakeSentences`
  multi-candidate beam) behind a named `luna_pinyin`/upstream profile, **without**
  disturbing the TypeDuck `sentence_candidate` heuristic (the `21.0` jyut6ping3
  penalty) or the upstream-first ABI, capturing both goldens non-circularly from the
  pinned `1.17.0` binary. The Track-2 item is complete; it remains explicitly **not** required for
  TypeDuck-Web parity. Octagram/`.gram` bigram models, the C++ plugin ABI, and
  `contextual_translation` beyond the two named tests stay out of scope.
  Detail: [`plans/archive/m17-plan-upstream-language-model-poet.md`](./plans/archive/m17-plan-upstream-language-model-poet.md).
- **M18 — Deployment & processor depth (complete)** — turned the dictionary subsystem from
  read-and-plan into read-write and teaches the Engine the punctuation-processor
  behaviors the M12 harness left blocked. Yune now parses source YAML and compiled
  `.table.bin`/`.prism.bin`/`.reverse.bin`, and `rime_dict_rebuild_plan` decisions can be
  executed by public writers. M18 added a pure-Rust darts double-array, a `speller/algebra`-driven
  prism generator, and public `build_table_bin`/`build_reverse_bin`/`build_prism_bin`
  writers (Yune's own round-trippable table/reverse format, not marisa) plus a rebuild
  executor. On the processor side it wires `ascii_punct` into an upstream no-op bypass
  and adds immediate-commit/confirm-unique/pair/list punctuation from upstream
  `punctuator.cc`, un-ignoring the two M12 blockers with fresh upstream fixtures.
  Detail: [`plans/archive/m18-plan-deployment-and-processor-depth.md`](./plans/archive/m18-plan-deployment-and-processor-depth.md).
- **M19 — Breadth (toward B, complete)** — onboards three common upstream schemas — Shuangpin
  (`double_pinyin`), Cangjie (`cangjie5`), Zhuyin (`bopomofo`) — into Yune's named
  compatibility set, each measured against the upstream `1.17.0` oracle through the
  existing M12 harness (`oracle-rime-probe.cs` capture → provenance-stamped
  `upstream-1.17.0/` fixtures → an owning parity test per schema modeled on
  `upstream_luna_pinyin_parity.rs`). It reuses Yune primitives — `SpellingAlgebra`
  (`xform`/`xlit`/`derive`/`fuzz`/`abbrev`/`erase`), `StaticTableTranslator`
  (`with_spelling_algebra`/`with_show_full_code`), the schema-driven `SpellerProcessor`
  — adding only the per-schema gaps a captured oracle case proves; sentence/lattice
  cases outside the M17-owned `luna_pinyin` fixtures need their own future oracle
  evidence before implementation. In parallel M19 *names* (does not
  package) the TypeDuck-profile ABI surface the parked M10 needs: the fork-only
  `config_list_append_{string,bool,int,double}` slots already exist as `#[no_mangle]`
  symbols in `config_api.rs` but are absent from the default `rime_get_api()` table, so
  M19 exposes them through an explicitly named opt-in profile accessor while keeping the
  default upstream `1.17.0` ABI byte-for-byte unchanged — satisfying graduation-contract
  item (1) of `typeduck-windows-backend-requirements.md` without reopening Windows
  packaging.
  Detail: [`plans/archive/m19-plan-breadth-schemas.md`](./plans/archive/m19-plan-breadth-schemas.md).
- **M22 — TypeDuck-Web playground feature-completeness + multi-schema + engine
  debug inspector** — the M20 successor (playground build-out, *not* M21's
  product-comparison protocol). Surfaces more of Yune's engine in the internal
  `third_party/typeduck-web/` harness across three separate buckets. **(1) Missing
  honest toggles:** the browser-safe user-facing controls M20 skipped —
  `traditionalization`, `disabled`, `extended_charset` (via `setOption()`; the option
  the always-on `CharsetFilter` reads, `filter/mod.rs:65-69`), and deploy-time
  `dictionary_exclude` (`schema_install.rs:281-297`); each active control now has
  browser evidence through status, candidate, or persisted-config output.
  `ascii_punct` remains absent because no browser-visible before/after evidence
  was captured for it. **(2)
  Read-only debug inspector (complete):** an opt-in per-keystroke panel observes
  segments + `segment_tags`, each candidate's source/quality/preedit/comment,
  spelling-algebra expansion, the filter pipeline, prediction scores vs the
  threshold, and AI staging with additive debug JSON only and **no default
  `RimeApi`/`RimeCandidate` ABI change**; Bucket 2 evidence lives under
  `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m22-bucket2-inspector/`, while the
  completed M22 evidence lives under
  `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m22-remaining-buckets/`. **(3)
  Multi-schema (highest leverage):**
  load three schemas — `jyut6ping3_mobile` + `cangjie5` + `luna_pinyin` — behind a
  schema-switcher that cleans up and re-initializes the browser runtime with the
  selected schema, with reverse lookup on both new schemas; unblocks `show_full_code` and the schema-switch
  surface M20 could only mark browser-surface N/A as a single-schema harness, and gives
  M21 a multi-schema surface. M18 removed the dictionary-build blocker, and M22
  records measured M18/M19-derived browser asset sizes for both new schemas.
  Honesty-gate
  exclusions (`uniquifier_filter`, `single_char_filter`, always-on `charset_filter`,
  schema-owned templates, internal `_`-prefixed options) stay inspect-only or
  always-on — never toggles.
  Detail: [`plans/archive/m22-plan-web-playground-multischema-inspector.md`](./plans/archive/m22-plan-web-playground-multischema-inspector.md).
- **AI-native frontend expansion** — the proven TypeDuck-Web surface stays
  default-off; Windows and other native frontend exposure wait for their own
  safety evidence.
- **iOS keyboard developer track** — future TypeDuck iOS or third-party keyboard
  work should build on the closed Cantonese engine-parity behavior, then define a
  Yune-native iOS package/host contract. Cantoboard/TypeDuck iOS build repos are
  reference material for static-linking, resource deployment, and keyboard-host
  constraints, not a C++ implementation template.

## Scope ledger

A living map so "parity" always names a target. Deferred rows move into *in
scope* only as a named target needs them; nothing here commits to a timeline, and
the *Non-goal* column is not a backlog. Standing deferrals also appear in
*Deferred / future* below.

| In scope — target-driven, measured | Deferred — implement when a target needs it | Non-goal |
|---|---|---|
| `luna_pinyin` core vs upstream `1.17.0` oracle, including M17 null-grammar sentence/lattice and M18 punctuation processor slices | Learned `.gram`/octagram grammar, contextual translation, and broader plugin-backed gears until a named target needs them | Bit-for-bit parity with librime internals |
| TypeDuck `jyut6ping3` profile vs `v1.1.2` oracle | Browser/userdb UI evidence after M15 engine parity; broader OpenCC phrase/config breadth beyond the checked-in `hk2s` source chain | librime C++ plugin ABI as a requirement |
| Common RIME schemas, as breadth (B) is added | Spelling-algebra prism generation; binary-dict / deployment writing | Cloud inference as a hard dependency |
| AI-native layer (M11) on the compatible base | `contextual_translation`, `unity_table_encoder`, deeper gear coverage | Replacing or altering classic input paths by default |
| TypeDuck-Web / TypeDuck profile surfaces, when named | iOS keyboard developer SDK: package format, Swift/Obj-C host API, resource bundle/deploy model, sandboxed userdb/storage, and mobile config hooks | Treating iOS build scripts as engine semantics |

---

## Deferred / future

- **librime C++ plugin ABI** (Lua, octagram, predict, proto): deferred until a concrete frontend or distribution requires it; prefer Yune-native extension points first.
- **AI-native input layer (future native/frontend expansion)** - after M13, TypeDuck-Web has a default-off local AI surface with browser safety evidence. Remaining AI-native product integration is exposing equivalent gates in additional real frontends without changing upstream-core, TypeDuck-Web classic behavior, or parked TypeDuck-Windows compatibility behavior. The architecture remains in [`plans/m11-design-ai-native.md`](./plans/m11-design-ai-native.md); CLI evidence lives in [`plans/archive/m11-plan-ai-native-cli-slice.md`](./plans/archive/m11-plan-ai-native-cli-slice.md), and web exposure evidence lives in [`plans/archive/m13-plan-ai-native-frontend-exposure.md`](./plans/archive/m13-plan-ai-native-frontend-exposure.md).
- **iOS keyboard developer support** - future TypeDuck iOS work needs its own
  track. The fork-parity ledger now classifies the Cantoboard/TypeDuck iOS build
  rows as deferred platform integration: useful for Apple build/static-linking,
  resource deployment, and keyboard-extension constraints, but outside the
  completed engine-parity backlog.

## Principles (carried forward)

The standing principles that govern all current and future work — librime as oracle not template, name-the-protected-behavior, own-each-slice, AI-native as a separate local-first layer, fixtures before module replacement, deferred plugin ABI, and upstream-first oracle sequencing — have one canonical home: [`decisions.md` → Standing principles](./decisions.md#standing-principles).
