# Roadmap

Yune is a Rust input-method engine that uses **upstream librime as a
compatibility and performance oracle** while building a cleaner Rust engine.
The current priority is not application integration. It is preserving engine
behavior while carrying completed M39 long-input hardening lessons into M40's
compiled sentence lookup index work.

> **Compatibility oracle.** Upstream librime latest stable is the default
> behavior reference for user-visible schema semantics, standard ABI contracts,
> deployed data, and migration. The current pinned upstream target is
> `rime/librime 1.17.0`
> (`33e78140250125871856cdc5b42ddc6a5fcd3cd4`):
> <https://github.com/rime/librime>. This is a referenced upstream repository,
> not a local checkout path.

## Current Snapshot

| Lane | Current state | Next decision or gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core compatibility | Phase 1 named-target upstream behavior is complete for `luna_pinyin` and common-schema basics against upstream librime `1.17.0`. | Preserve upstream-observable behavior on every engine change. |
| Engine performance | M39 closed the post-M38 long-input hardening gates in native engine evidence. Startup/runtime-ready is Yune `25,048.200us` versus librime `27,314.000us` (`0.917x`), session is `25,255.500us` versus `26,938.500us` (`0.938x`), `hao`/`ni`/`zhongguo` remain inside gates, the 37-character Track A row is `514.903us` versus `291.786us` (`1.765x`), and the 59-character Track A row is `917.961us` versus `695.653us` (`1.320x`). The Track B Cantonese 50+ row is separately gated at `188.857us/op` median and `194.910us/op` p95, below its Phase 0 profile baseline. | M40 is active: combine exact range indexing, reachable-vertex pruning, prefix filtering, and a librime-shaped table phrase index for Track A sentence lookup, plus a measured verdict on cross-keystroke graph rebuild. Closeout is blocked on long-row improvement, startup/session no-regression, memory no-regression, storage hot-path preservation, and fresh native evidence. |
| AI-native engine layer | M11/M13 proved a default-off local AI layer can sit on top of the deterministic engine. | Keep AI outside the classic deterministic performance path unless a named engine experiment explicitly enables it. |
| Future platform work | Platform-specific frontends and application shells are outside this roadmap. | Start a separate repository or separate plan before changing platform/application contracts. |

## Authoritative Sequence

1. **M40 compiled sentence lookup index** - active native-engine-only
   performance work. It must combine exact range indexing, reachable-vertex
   pruning, prefix filtering, and a librime-shaped table phrase index without
   regressing startup, memory, short rows, mmap/`rsmarisa`, bounded output, or
   upstream-observable behavior. It also must report whether cross-keystroke
   graph rebuild becomes the next owner after those index changes.
2. **Future AI-native engine experiments** - later, and only after classic
   engine performance is no longer dominated by avoidable pipeline costs.
3. **Future engine memory or profile-storage slices** - only with a new scoped
   plan, fresh owner evidence, and native-engine-only claims unless browser
   evidence is explicitly collected.

Trigger-gated, not scheduled: extracting the full processor pipeline from
`yune-rime-api` into `yune-core` lands only when a real non-ABI consumer needs
the full input path. Do not milestone that extraction speculatively.

## M40 Active Plan

M40 is active under
[`plans/active/m40-plan-compiled-sentence-lookup-index.md`](./plans/active/m40-plan-compiled-sentence-lookup-index.md).
It follows directly from the post-M39 bottleneck: Track A long rows are no
longer broken by raw table lookup, context export, or `rsmarisa` activation.
The remaining gap is the sentence lookup shape around `word_graph_for_input`.

M40 combines four strategies as hard gates:

- exact-code `HashMap`/range indexing over sentence entries;
- reachable-vertex pruning so unreachable start positions are skipped;
- valid-code/prefix filtering so impossible substrings do not reach table
  lookup;
- a librime-shaped table phrase index so the final runtime walks indexed
  prefix nodes and weighted entry ranges rather than the old all-substrings
  loop.

The caveat is startup and memory. M40 cannot close by building a large eager
heap mirror of the dictionary. The sentence index must be lazy, shared,
borrowed, interned, or otherwise proven cheap enough by first-use, warm reuse,
working-set, peak, and owner evidence. If the index moves long-row latency but
regresses startup/session or Track A memory beyond the gates, M40 remains open.

M40 is deliberately not a web-harness or product-delivery milestone. Those
paths can and should get separate evidence later, but they do not change this
engine-first goal: continue driving the isolated core runtime toward
librime-class sentence lookup behavior after the M39 gate passed.

## M39 Closeout

M39 is complete. It was not a single-row speedup milestone; it closed a
whole-engine regression gate across startup/session, short rows, Track A long
rows, the Track B Cantonese profile long row, storage, memory, and behavior.

Final M39 native comparison:

- Warm startup/runtime-ready: Yune `25,048.200us`, librime `27,314.000us`
  (`0.917x`).
- Session create/select/destroy: Yune `25,255.500us`, librime `26,938.500us`
  (`0.938x`).
- `hao`: Yune `38.933us`, librime `11.867us` (`3.281x`).
- `ni`: Yune `56.200us`, librime `14.550us` (`3.863x`).
- `zhongguo`: Yune `60.588us`, librime `183.887us` (`0.329x`).
- `ceshiyixiachangjushuruxingnengzenyang`: Yune `514.903us`, librime
  `291.786us` (`1.765x`).
- `zhegeyinqingqishiyinggaizhichichaochangjuzishurucainengyong`: Yune
  `917.961us`, librime `695.653us` (`1.320x`).
- `jyut6ping3_mobile`
  `neigojangingkeisatjinggoiziwunciucoenggeoizisyujapsinhojijung`: final Yune
  median `188.857us/op`, p95 `194.910us/op`, below Phase 0.

M39 proved the owner split before implementation: Track A was dominated by
upstream sentence-model scanning, while Track B was a profile-specific
no-marisa prefix/fallback path. The final Track A path keeps
`selected_storage=rsmarisa_byte_backed`, table/prism `mmap`, selected heap
mirrors `0`, positive runtime `rsmarisa` exact/prefix counters, and bounded
first-page output. Track B keeps byte-backed mmap storage and profile fallback
semantics without regressing the 50+ row. Final reports remain native-engine
claims only.

## M37 Closeout

M37 is complete. It improved native engine storage and candidate
materialization, but it also made the key lesson clearer: end-to-end
application-shaped rows are not the right optimization target for the next milestone.
M38 therefore treats M37 as history and returns to a clean upstream
Yune-versus-librime engine comparison.

Engine lessons carried forward:

- Full-list candidate materialization can dominate short ambiguous input.
- Page-sized context export is required before frontend-shaped rows can be
  meaningful.
- Mapped or byte-backed deployed data helps memory only if it avoids rebuilding
  parallel heap mirrors.
- A storage probe is not the same thing as a runtime lookup backend.
- `rsmarisa` is an engine-performance concern when it is the route to a real
  marisa-backed table hot path.
- A faster lookup backend does not close the milestone if candidate production
  still expands and sorts a full list for a first-page read.
- Native engine wins must not be described as application, browser, or delivery
  wins without separate evidence.

## M38 Closeout

M38 is complete. The final clean upstream comparison meets the engine latency,
storage, lookup, iteration, behavior, and quality gates while keeping memory
caveats explicit.

M38 final upstream comparison:

- Warm startup/runtime-ready: Yune `23,363.300us`, librime `24,351.000us`
  (`0.959x`).
- Session create/select/destroy: Yune `24,243.500us`, librime `27,969.500us`
  (`0.867x`).
- `hao`: Yune `38.933us`, librime `11.400us` (`3.415x`).
- `ni`: Yune `56.750us`, librime `14.300us` (`3.969x`).
- `zhongguo`: Yune `64.263us`, librime `181.375us` (`0.354x`).
- Median working set: Yune `108-112 MB`, librime `10-13 MB`; selected
  table/prism heap mirror bytes are `0`.

Post-M38 coverage update: long continuous pinyin rows have now been measured
under [`reports/evidence/post-m38-long-input-baseline/baseline-native/`](./reports/evidence/post-m38-long-input-baseline/baseline-native/)
and [`reports/evidence/post-m38-long-input-baseline/stress-59-native/`](./reports/evidence/post-m38-long-input-baseline/stress-59-native/).
They are not in parity: `ceshiyixiachangjushuruxingnengzenyang` is Yune
`412,192.727us`, librime `294.151us`, or `1,401.296x` slower; the 59-character
`zhegeyinqingqishiyinggaizhichichaochangjuzishurucainengyong` stress row is
Yune `1,202,404.588us`, librime `702.212us`, or `1,712.310x` slower. The next
engine-performance plan must keep both rows, add the Cantonese
`jyut6ping3_mobile`
`neigojangingkeisatjinggoiziwunciucoenggeoizisyujapsinhojijung` row, treat 50+
uninterrupted input as a primary engine requirement, instrument the
long-composition/profile translator path and length curve, and close or
explicitly no-go the measured owner before claiming broader typing parity.

The current runs record memory baselines. Track A median working set is
`107,839,488-114,728,960 B` for Yune versus `11,091,968-15,884,288 B` for
librime (`7.22-9.72x`), and Yune max peak is `163,057,664-163,119,104 B`
versus librime `14,045,184-16,154,624 B` (`10.10-11.61x`). This is measured
working-set/peak evidence, not heap-owner attribution.

Closed M38 gates:

- Final Track A selected storage is `rsmarisa_byte_backed`, with positive
  `rsmarisa` exact/prefix lookup counters and zero ordinary no-marisa fallback.
- Final selected Track A table/prism bytes are mmap-backed and have no selected
  heap mirror.
- Ordinary first-page reads are page-bounded for the target rows.
- Final reports make native isolated-engine claims only; no frontend, browser,
  product, packaging, deployment, or public-delivery speed claim is made.

## Track Map

| Track | Scope | Current source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine performance | Native engine startup, schema/session lifecycle, mmap-backed `rsmarisa` marisa-table lookup, lazy/page-bounded translation, context export, memory, allocation, and active M40 sentence lookup indexing | Active M40 plan: [`plans/active/m40-plan-compiled-sentence-lookup-index.md`](./plans/active/m40-plan-compiled-sentence-lookup-index.md). Completed M39 plan: [`plans/completed/m39-plan-long-input-engine-hardening.md`](./plans/completed/m39-plan-long-input-engine-hardening.md). |
| Core compatibility | Upstream behavior fixtures and standard ABI-observable behavior | [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md), [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md), and per-milestone plans. |
| AI-native engine research | Default-off AI behavior layered above the deterministic engine | Future explicit engine experiments only. |
| Historical record | Completed milestone outcomes and reference/provenance pointers | [`ledgers/milestone-history.md`](./ledgers/milestone-history.md). |

## Milestone Ledger

| Milestone or track | Status | Current roadmap meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0-M24 | Complete | Phase 1 named-target engine/basic oracle parity is complete; history lives in [`ledgers/milestone-history.md`](./ledgers/milestone-history.md). |
| M25-M30 | Complete | Early performance and runtime-hardening work is historical context only. |
| M31 | Complete | Public demo delivery is historical context and not a current engine-performance target. |
| M33-M39 | Complete | Recent engine-performance work closed fairness, shared caches, compact storage, compiled-active paths, page-bounded materialization, mapped storage, pure upstream `luna_pinyin` native parity with `rsmarisa` hot-path lookup, and M39 long-input hardening for both Track A long rows plus the Track B Cantonese profile long row. |
| M40 | Active | Compiled sentence lookup index milestone combining exact range indexing, reachable-vertex pruning, prefix filtering, a librime-shaped table phrase index, and a cross-keystroke rebuild verdict while blocking startup, memory, short-row, storage, and behavior regressions. |

## Scope Ledger

A living map so "parity" always names a target. Deferred rows move into scope
only when an engine target needs them; nothing here commits to a timeline.

| In scope - target-driven, measured | Deferred - implement when an engine target needs it | Non-goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `luna_pinyin` core versus upstream `1.17.0`, including completed M17 null-grammar sentence/lattice and M18 punctuation processor slices | Learned `.gram`/octagram grammar, contextual translation, and broader plugin-backed gears until a named engine target needs them | Bit-for-bit parity with librime internals |
| Common RIME schemas added through explicit breadth milestones | Further schema breadth only with fresh oracle fixtures and owning tests | Unbounded schema checklist work |
| Native engine performance parity for startup, session lifecycle, mmap-backed `rsmarisa` marisa-table lookup, raw lookup, lazy/page-bounded translation, context export, memory, and allocation | Frontend/application delivery evidence and platform packaging | Claiming application-visible wins from native engine evidence |
| AI-native layer on the compatible deterministic base | Richer AI experiments after the classic engine path is competitive | Replacing or altering classic input paths by default |

## Deferred / Future

- **librime C++ plugin ABI** (Lua, octagram, predict, proto): deferred until a
  concrete engine target requires it; prefer Yune-native extension points first.
- **AI-native input layer beyond M13:** future work owns richer local-first AI
  behavior, privacy/memory controls, and any explicit remote-provider decision.
  Until then, proven AI remains default-off and outside the classic performance
  path.
- **Frontend/application delivery:** platform UI, browser delivery, packaging,
  cache behavior, and public deployment are outside the engine roadmap. They
  need separate plans and separate evidence.
- **iOS keyboard developer support:** future keyboard SDK or host work needs
  its own Yune-native package/host contract.

## Principles

The standing principles that govern all current and future work - librime as
oracle not template, name-the-protected-behavior, own-each-slice, AI-native as
a separate local-first layer, fixtures before module replacement, deferred
plugin ABI, and upstream-first oracle sequencing - have one canonical home:
[`decisions.md` -> Standing principles](./decisions.md#standing-principles).
