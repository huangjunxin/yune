# iOS-Budget Native Memory Report

Date: 2026-06-29

This report measures Yune's **native single-active-schema memory** against an iOS
keyboard-extension budget (hard **64 MB**, target **48 MB**). It is a different
lens from
[`yune-vs-librime-performance.md`](./yune-vs-librime-performance.md) (which tracks
librime *parity*): here the bar is a **product memory budget**, because the
intended product is a Cantoboard-style iOS keyboard
([Cantoboard](https://github.com/Cantoboard/Cantoboard),
[librime-ios-build](https://github.com/Cantoboard/librime-ios-build)). The
reduction work it motivates is tracked by
[`plans/active/m47-plan-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction.md`](../plans/active/m47-plan-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction.md).

Findings were adversarially verified (2026-06-28 workflow: 4 refute agents +
synthesis); the calibration corrections below are folded in.

## Harness hygiene (read first)

**Every memory number must name its harness.** Three different processes give
three different numbers; only one is the iOS proxy:

| Source | jyut6ping3_mobile | What it is |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Initial lean native probe | **~298 MB steady / 482 MB peak** | Original M47 baseline: real `RimeApi`, mmap path, prebuilt assets, one schema per fresh Rust process |
| Current lean lower-bound probe after RED-07 | **56.9 MB steady / 61.3 MB peak** | Memory-light lower bound after RED-01/RED-03/RED-04 opt-outs plus RED-05/RED-06/RED-07 storage work; it intentionally omits rich TypeDuck dictionary comments and reverse UI |
| Current comments-intact keyboard probe after RED-08 | **67.4 MB steady / 80.1 MB peak** | Product-honest keyboard proxy with rich TypeDuck comments retained and grave-prefix reverse UI omitted |
| Current full mobile probe after RED-08 | **78.8 MB steady / 89.9 MB peak** | Full `jyut6ping3_mobile` profile, including grave-prefix reverse UI |
| .NET in-process benchmark (Track B) | ~436 MB after-ready / 504 MB peak | A .NET process hosting **both** Yune *and* librime DLLs — polluted upper bound, **not** the iOS number |
| Browser WASM | 160 MiB | WASM linear memory, **no mmap**, owned tables — a different deployment |

The earlier "Jyutping native ~504 MB" headline was the dual-DLL harness; the
iOS-relevant steady was initially **~298 MB**. After RED-08, the lean lower
bound remains **56.9 MB** steady / **61.3 MB** peak, while the comments-intact
keyboard proxy is **67.4 MB** steady / **80.1 MB** peak.

## Methodology

Probe: [`crates/yune-rime-api/tests/native_memory_probe.rs`](../../crates/yune-rime-api/tests/native_memory_probe.rs)
(evidence-only, `#[ignore]`). It drives the native `RimeApi`
(`setup`→`initialize`→`deploy`→`create_session`→`select_schema`→`process_key`)
with `prebuilt_data_dir` set to the committed `.bin` bundle, so `deploy()`
**reuses + mmaps** the compiled assets instead of rebuilding — exactly how an iOS
keyboard loads precompiled bundle assets. It reads this process's own
`WorkingSet64`/`PeakWorkingSet64` at each phase; one schema per fresh process
removes cross-schema contamination; the ~5 MB harness baseline is recorded and
subtracted. Verified faithful (C1, high confidence): the native load path mmaps
via `memmap2` (`schema_install.rs`), and the search order returns the deployed
staging copy.

## Measurement caveat (what this proxy does and does not say)

Windows `WorkingSet64` is **total resident physical memory**, including clean,
shared, file-backed (mmap'd) pages. iOS jetsam accounts a keyboard extension
roughly by **`phys_footprint` (dirty + compressed memory)**, which *excludes*
clean mmap'd pages that can be evicted and re-faulted. So the iOS number for the
same engine could be **lower** than this Windows working set — but, as GPT's
review put it, *a ~300 MB native session footprint does not become 48 MB by
platform accounting alone*. M47 Phase 0 now records Windows `PrivateUsage` and
allocator-live evidence for the dirty/private side of that gap; treat every
number here as a Windows proxy that justifies the work, not as an iOS
`phys_footprint`. The on-device figure is a later Phase 2 validation gate.

**Independent reproduction (GPT review, 2026-06-28, separate Windows machine):**
after_deploy `14.9`, after_session `297.5`, after_select/steady `302.3`, peak
`486.0` MB — same shape and magnitude as below (deploy cheap; `create_session`
is the owner; ~300 MB steady / ~486 MB peak).

## Findings

### 1. The cost is at `create_session`, not `deploy` (verified, high confidence)

jyut6ping3_mobile, lean probe, phase by phase:

| Phase | Working set |
| --- | ---: |
| baseline (harness) | 5.2 MB |
| after `setup`+`initialize` | 5.9 MB |
| **after `deploy()`** | **10.8 MB** |
| **after `create_session()`** | **293.4 MB** (+283 MB) |
| after `select_schema` | 298.3 MB |
| after typing | 298.4 MB |
| **steady** | **298.4 MB** |
| **peak** | **482.0 MB** |

`deploy()` (compile/reuse) is nearly free. The +283 MB lands at
`create_session()`, which eagerly loads the workspace **default** schema's
dictionary and materializes heap structures
(`apply_initial_schema_to_session` → `install_schema_translator_chain` →
`CompactTableStore::from_table_bin_byte_source` + `read_yune_table_advanced_payload`
+ `StaticTableTranslator::from_compact_table_store`, which collects
`all_codes()` into a `normal_codes` HashSet).

### 2. It scales with the default dictionary, not a fixed cost (verified)

By patching `default.yaml`'s `schema_list` to isolate the default schema that
`create_session` loads:

| Default/active schema | Steady WS | Peak WS |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| luna_pinyin | **62.6 MB** | 294 MB |
| cangjie5 | **94.9 MB** | 102 MB |
| jyut6ping3_mobile | **~298 MB** | 482 MB |

The earlier "~constant ~300 MB across schemas" was an artifact of `create_session`
always loading the default `jyut6ping3` before any switch. Only jyut shows a large
steady↔peak gap (a ~184 MB transient that frees back); luna's 294 MB peak frees to
62 MB steady.

### 3. What it is *not* (verified)

- **Not the sentence model.** A/B disabling `enable_sentence`+`enable_completion`
  for jyut moved steady 298→297 MB (≈ 0). `poet`/sentence-model owner rows are 0
  bytes for jyut (`with_upstream_sentence_model` is only used for luna_pinyin).
- **Not OpenCC.** All `.ocd2` simplifier dictionaries total **77 KB**.

### 4. Pre-Phase-0 classification left ~235 MB un-owned

Before M47 Phase 0, the owner profile
([`track-b-yune-product/memory-owner-profile.csv`](./evidence/current-performance-dashboard-2026-06-28/native-current-benchmark/track-b-yune-product/memory-owner-profile.csv)):

| Owner | Bytes | Class |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `compact_table.lookup_records` (primary) | 31.9 MB | heap_owned_required |
| `compact_table.lookup_records` (secondary) | 8.1 MB | heap_owned_required (dictionary loaded twice) |
| `compact_table.syllabary_codes` | ~4.2 MB | heap_owned_reducible |
| `compact_table.storage` (table) | ~15 MB | **mmap_file_backed** (not private heap) |
| **Classified heap-required** | **~44 MB** | |

Against the lean probe's **298 MB** steady, classified heap (~44 MB) + mmap'd
file pages (~18 MB, which are clean/shared, not private dirty) left **~235 MB
un-owned**. That was the Phase 0 blocker, not the final attribution. The closeout
below adds private bytes, allocator live/high-water, filter owner rows, and
inside-load phase markers.

## Phase 0 attribution closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-28)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-attribution-2026-06-28/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-attribution-2026-06-28/)
from the extended native probe. This is Windows `WorkingSetSize` /
`PrivateUsage` evidence plus a test-local counting allocator, **not** iOS
`phys_footprint`.

Two runs matter:

| Run | Steady WS | Peak WS | Steady private | Allocator live | Allocator high-water | Named heap owners | Clean mmap estimate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Default-list baseline (`default.yaml` first schema, then select `jyut6ping3_mobile`) | **301.2 MB** | **485.1 MB** | **284.7 MB** | **191.5 MB** | **415.1 MB** | 152.7 MB after `create_session` | 14.5 MB after `create_session` |
| Isolated mobile default (`YUNE_MEM_DEFAULT=jyut6ping3_mobile`) | **223.9 MB** | **231.5 MB** | **202.4 MB** | **155.0 MB** | **164.8 MB** | **96.6 MB** | **19.0 MB** |

Phase 0 verdict: the steady-state bulk is **not primarily allocator-retained
free memory**. The isolated mobile run ends at `~202 MB` private bytes with
`~155 MB` allocator-live bytes and only `~165 MB` allocator high-water, so an
allocator decay strategy cannot be the first branch. The remaining unclassified
steady mass is live retained heap / process-private memory that needs owner
reduction.

The formerly "un-owned" bucket is now smaller and more concrete:

- Default-list `create_session`: `~285 MB` private, `~220 MB` allocator live,
  `~153 MB` named heap, `~15 MB` clean mmap estimate. Remaining unclassified
  private is roughly `~132 MB`; unclassified Rust-allocator live is roughly
  `~68 MB`.
- Isolated mobile: `~202 MB` private, `~155 MB` allocator live, `~97 MB` named
  heap, `~19 MB` clean mmap estimate. Remaining unclassified private is roughly
  `~106 MB`; unclassified Rust-allocator live is roughly `~58 MB`.

The double/side load is confirmed and owner-named:

| Owner | Bytes | Required for normal keyboard candidate text? | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Primary `jyut6ping3` compact table `lookup_records` | 31.9 MB | No; rich lookup/comment records, not candidate generation | Lazy/skip candidate for keyboard-only path |
| Secondary `luna_pinyin_yune_reverse` compact table `lookup_records` | 13.8 MB | No for unprefixed Jyutping; used by grave-prefix Mandarin reverse lookup UI | Lazy-load on reverse trigger or optional UI pack |
| `dictionary_lookup_filter.lookup_records` (`jyut6ping3_scolar`) | 50.7 MB | No; dictionary-panel/comment enrichment filter | Highest-leverage lazy/optional branch |

This table selected RED-01 first and remains the Phase 0 pre-reduction ordering.
The post-RED-01 prism attribution correction below supersedes the next-branch
order: run prism storage/lazy parsing before reverse/UI lazy loading. Keep
candidate-output correctness gates green; this is not an allocator-strategy
branch.

## RED-01 reduction closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-28)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red01-2026-06-28/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red01-2026-06-28/)
from the same native probe. This is Windows `WorkingSetSize` / `PrivateUsage`
evidence, not iOS `phys_footprint`.

RED-01 adds an explicit keyboard-profile gate:
`dictionary_lookup_filter/load_lookup_records: false`. When set, schema install
skips loading and retaining `jyut6ping3_scolar` lookup records. The default is
still eager (`true`), so public/web and TypeDuck-rich-comment paths remain
unchanged unless a profile opts out.

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Steady WS | **223.9 MB** | **169.2 MB** | **-54.7 MB** |
| Steady private | **202.2 MB** | **147.7 MB** | **-54.5 MB** |
| Steady allocator live | **155.0 MB** | **104.9 MB** | **-50.1 MB** |
| Peak WS | **231.6 MB** | **217.3 MB** | **-14.3 MB** |
| Named heap owners | **96.6 MB** | **48.2 MB** | **-48.4 MB** |

The measured owner delta is direct: `dictionary_lookup_filter.lookup_records`
went from `50,695,595 B` / `127,144` records in the before owner profile to no
owner row in the after profile. Candidate correctness remains covered by the
committed Jyutping asset regression; dictionary-panel comments and TypeDuck
comment parity remain preserved on the default/eager path. For the keyboard
profile, dictionary-panel enrichment is intentionally disabled, not lazily
loaded on first request.

RED-01 is a meaningful reduction but not close to the target: after the branch,
isolated `jyut6ping3_mobile` is still **~3.5x** over the 48 MB steady target and
**~3.4x** over the 64 MB peak target. The named heap total in this RED-01 table
was later corrected by the prism attribution section below.

## Post-RED-01 prism attribution correction (Windows-measured, 2026-06-28)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-prism-attribution-2026-06-28/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-prism-attribution-2026-06-28/)
from the same native probe and RED-01 keyboard-profile opt-out. This is an
owner-table correction, not a reduction branch.

| Metric | RED-01 owner table | Corrected owner table | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Steady WS | **169.2 MB** | **169.1 MB** | noise only |
| Steady private | **147.7 MB** | **146.6 MB** | noise only |
| Steady allocator live | **104.9 MB** | **104.9 MB** | **0.0 MB** |
| Peak WS | **217.3 MB** | **217.2 MB** | noise only |
| Named heap owners | **48.2 MB** | **86.6 MB** | **+38.4 MB** |
| Named total owners | **70.3 MB** | **108.7 MB** | **+38.4 MB** |

The corrected owner rows name parsed prism payload heap retained by
`StaticTableTranslator`:

| Owner | Bytes | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `prism.spelling_map` | `31,337,240 B` | Largest newly named owner; parsed spelling descriptor vectors. |
| `prism.double_array_units` | `8,896,560 B` | Parsed Darts double-array units. |
| `prism.corrections_tolerance` | `96 B` | Empty correction/tolerance vector headers in this profile. |
| `prism.tips_payload` | `0 B` | No non-empty descriptor tips in this profile. |

The primary `jyut6ping3_mobile` prism accounts for `28,767,208 B` of spelling
map and `8,388,632 B` of double-array units; `luna_pinyin_yune_reverse` accounts
for `2,570,032 B` and `507,928 B`. `dictionary_lookup_filter.lookup_records`
remains absent, so RED-01's keyboard-profile skip is still active.

## RED-02 prism runtime storage closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-28)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-prism-storage-2026-06-28/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-prism-storage-2026-06-28/)
from the same native probe and RED-01 keyboard-profile opt-out. The `before/`
folder is the 682be75a prism-attribution baseline; `current/` is the RED-02
runtime parser result.

RED-02 keeps the public owned prism parser intact for fixture/facade tests, but
compiled native runtime loading now stores a `RimePrismRuntimePayload` that reads
the Darts double-array units and spelling-map descriptors from the existing
compiled prism byte source instead of expanding them into heap-owned `Vec<u32>`
and `Vec<Vec<RimePrismSpellingDescriptor>>` structures.

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Steady WS | **169.1 MB** | **138.1 MB** | **-31.0 MB** |
| Steady private | **146.6 MB** | **101.8 MB** | **-44.8 MB** |
| Steady allocator live | **104.9 MB** | **66.6 MB** | **-38.3 MB** |
| Peak WS | **217.2 MB** | **172.1 MB** | **-45.1 MB** |
| Named heap owners | **86.6 MB** | **48.2 MB** | **-38.4 MB** |

| Owner | Before | After | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `prism.double_array_units` | `8,896,560 B` heap | `8,896,512 B` mmap-backed | Moved to byte-backed runtime reads. |
| `prism.spelling_map` | `31,337,240 B` heap | `11,955,056 B` mmap-backed | Moved to lazy byte-backed descriptor reads; raw descriptor bytes are smaller than heap expansion. |
| `prism.corrections_tolerance` | `96 B` heap | `96 B` heap | Unchanged small parsed metadata. |
| `compact_table.lookup_records` | `45,689,298 B` heap | `45,689,298 B` heap | Largest remaining heap owner. |

RED-02 is a successful reduction but not a budget closeout: the isolated mobile
keyboard profile is still roughly **2.9x** over the 48 MB steady target and
**2.7x** over the 64 MB peak target on the Windows proxy harness. The next
measured blocker is compact lookup-record materialization, not prism storage.

## RED-03 compact lookup-record closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-28)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-lookup-records-2026-06-28/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-lookup-records-2026-06-28/)
from the same native probe, with RED-01 enabled and RED-03 applied through the
temporary deployed schema's `translator/load_lookup_records: false` and
`luna_pinyin/load_lookup_records: false` settings. The committed public schema
bundle is unchanged, and the parser default remains eager.

RED-03 keeps table assets and default rich lookup behavior intact, but compact
runtime parsing can now validate and walk the `YUNE-LOOKUP` advanced payload
without retaining `HashMap<String, Vec<DictionaryLookupRecord>>` when a
translator namespace opts out.

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Steady WS | **137.8 MB** | **69.4 MB** | **-68.4 MB** |
| Steady private | **102.8 MB** | **30.2 MB** | **-72.6 MB** |
| Steady allocator live | **66.6 MB** | **20.4 MB** | **-46.2 MB** |
| Peak WS | **172.1 MB** | **80.8 MB** | **-91.3 MB** |
| Named heap owners | **48.2 MB** | **4.6 MB** | **-43.6 MB** |

| Owner | Before | After | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Primary `jyut6ping3_mobile` `compact_table.lookup_records` | `31,920,140 B` / `127,144` records | `48 B` / `0` records | Skipped in keyboard-profile run. |
| Secondary `luna_pinyin_yune_reverse` `compact_table.lookup_records` | `13,769,158 B` / `70,807` records | `48 B` / `0` records | Skipped in keyboard-profile run. |
| `compact_table.lookup_records` total | `45,689,298 B` / `197,951` records | `96 B` / `0` records | RED-03 measured heap owner removed. |
| `compact_table.syllabary_codes` total | `4,850,892 B` | `4,850,892 B` | Top remaining named heap owner. |

Mmap/file-backed owner rows stayed flat at `40,740,505 B`, so this branch
removed live retained heap rather than clean file mappings. The steady Windows
working set is now roughly **1.45x** over the 48 MB target, and the peak is still
roughly **1.26x** over the 64 MB target.

## RED-04 reverse/UI optional pack closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-28)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red04-2026-06-28/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red04-2026-06-28/)
from the same native probe, with RED-01 and RED-03 enabled and RED-04 applied
through the temporary deployed schema's `luna_pinyin/load_translator: false`
setting. The committed public schema bundle is unchanged, and default reverse
lookup behavior remains eager.

RED-04 adds an explicit optional-pack gate: a translator namespace can set
`load_translator: false` to skip installing that translator before any dictionary
load. This is not behavior-preserving first-use lazy loading; with the gate
enabled for `luna_pinyin`, the grave-prefix Mandarin reverse lookup UI is
intentionally absent from that keyboard-profile run.

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Steady WS | **69.2 MB** | **58.5 MB** | **-10.7 MB** |
| Steady private | **29.7 MB** | **23.3 MB** | **-6.4 MB** |
| Steady allocator live | **20.4 MB** | **16.0 MB** | **-4.4 MB** |
| Peak WS | **80.7 MB** | **81.0 MB** | **+0.3 MB** |
| Named owners | **48.9 MB** | **41.4 MB** | **-7.5 MB** |

| Owner | Before | After | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `compact_table.storage` | `19,888,937 B` mmap-backed | `15,248,382 B` mmap-backed | Secondary reverse table mapping omitted. |
| `prism.spelling_map` | `11,955,056 B` mmap-backed | `10,965,828 B` mmap-backed | Secondary reverse prism spelling-map bytes omitted. |
| `prism.double_array_units` | `8,896,512 B` mmap-backed | `8,388,608 B` mmap-backed | Secondary reverse prism double-array bytes omitted. |
| `compact_table.syllabary_codes` | `4,850,892 B` heap | `4,189,674 B` heap | Secondary reverse syllabary code Vec omitted. |

RED-04 is a useful steady-state profile gate but not a peak closeout. The peak
is still **~81 MB**, so the next blocker is the remaining transient/high-water
path rather than retained reverse/UI data.

## RED-05 deploy transient closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-28)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red05-2026-06-28/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red05-2026-06-28/)
from the same native probe, with RED-01, RED-03, and RED-04 keyboard-profile
gates enabled. The `before` reference is the RED-04 `current/` folder; RED-05's
`current/` folder is the measured post-change run.

RED-05 adds deployment-phase memory markers and removes the deploy-time rebuild
transient for the keyboard profile. Deployment now reads only fixed-size compiled
artifact headers for reuse checks, the lookup-filter side dictionary request is
skipped when `dictionary_lookup_filter/load_lookup_records: false`, and that
lookup-record gate is normalized out of unrelated dictionary artifact checksums
so primary/reverse prebuilt artifacts are still reused.

| Metric | Before (RED-04 current) | After RED-05 | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Steady WS | **58.5 MB** | **56.9 MB** | **-1.6 MB** |
| Steady private | **23.3 MB** | **23.7 MB** | **+0.4 MB** |
| Steady allocator live | **16.0 MB** | **16.0 MB** | **0.0 MB** |
| Peak WS | **81.0 MB** | **78.4 MB** | **-2.6 MB** |
| Allocator high-water | **59.9 MB** | **35.4 MB** | **-24.5 MB** |
| After-deploy WS | **11.8 MB** | **8.8 MB** | **-3.0 MB** |
| After-deploy peak WS | **81.0 MB** | **12.4 MB** | **-68.6 MB** |
| After-deploy allocator high-water | **59.9 MB** | **3.7 MB** | **-56.2 MB** |

The RED-05 events show deploy no longer owns the run's peak: the deploy plan
reuses prebuilt `luna_pinyin`, `luna_pinyin_yune_reverse`, and `jyut6ping3`
artifacts, and the `jyut6ping3_scolar` side-dictionary build row is absent. The
remaining peak occurs during `create_session()`, at
`m47:compiled_dictionary:jyut6ping3:after_compact_table_store_parse`: working set
**69.1 MB**, process peak **78.4 MB**, allocator live **27.7 MB**, allocator
high-water **35.4 MB**. The next measured branch is therefore the primary
`jyut6ping3` compact-table load/parse transient, not deploy or allocator decay.

## Profile pin and RED-06 closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-29)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-keyboard-profile-pin-2026-06-29/`](./evidence/m47-ios-keyboard-profile-pin-2026-06-29/)
and
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red06-2026-06-29/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red06-2026-06-29/)
from the same native probe. These are Windows `WorkingSetSize` /
`PrivateUsage` measurements, not iOS `phys_footprint`.

The profile names are now pinned:

| Profile | Probe config | Steady WS after RED-06 | Peak WS after RED-06 | Product meaning |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Committed default workspace | `default.yaml` first schema (`jyut6ping3`), then active `jyut6ping3` | **268.6 MB** | **487.7 MB** | Full committed workspace default. It is not the iOS keyboard budget profile. |
| Full mobile profile | `YUNE_MEM_DEFAULT=jyut6ping3_mobile`, no memory opt-outs | **195.2 MB** | **202.7 MB** | Full mobile TypeDuck-style behavior with dictionary lookup/comment and reverse/UI packs eager. |
| Lean keyboard profile proxy | `YUNE_MEM_DEFAULT=jyut6ping3_mobile` plus RED-01/RED-03/RED-04 opt-outs | **58.0 MB** | **62.9 MB** | Current M47 iOS-keyboard budget profile: normal Jyutping typing retained; dictionary-panel rich comments and grave-prefix Mandarin reverse UI omitted. |

The lean keyboard profile uses these explicit opt-outs in the temporary probe
schema: `dictionary_lookup_filter/load_lookup_records: false`,
`translator/load_lookup_records: false`, `luna_pinyin/load_lookup_records: false`,
and `luna_pinyin/load_translator: false`. It is therefore wrong to describe the
`~58 MB` row as the full product. It is the current memory-light keyboard
profile. Normal table candidate comments remain; TypeDuck rich dictionary-panel
comment bytes are intentionally absent from this profile and remain covered on
the full/default eager path.

The new browser-shaped keyboard-profile gate
`yune_web_adapter_keyboard_profile_optouts_keep_jyutping_core_behavior` proves
that the opt-out profile still produces normal Jyutping output (`cak`), a
multi-syllable phrase (`ngogokdak`), reported matching-regression rows
(`litbiu`, `ngojiu`, `honangwui`), and the M28 follow-up phrase/ranking guard.
It also asserts the product trade-off: rich `dictionary_lookup_filter` comment
bytes are omitted in the lean keyboard profile.

RED-06 bounds the primary `create_session()` parse transient by dropping the
primary reverse `.bin` byte buffer and parsed reverse dictionary immediately
after their advanced data has been merged. Default/full behavior is unchanged:
the full mobile and committed-default rows stayed essentially flat.

| Metric | Fresh RED-05 lean baseline | After RED-06 | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Steady WS | **58.1 MB** | **58.0 MB** | **-0.1 MB** |
| Steady private | **23.3 MB** | **23.3 MB** | **0.0 MB** |
| Steady allocator live | **16.0 MB** | **16.0 MB** | **0.0 MB** |
| Peak WS | **79.6 MB** | **62.9 MB** | **-16.7 MB** |
| Allocator high-water | **35.4 MB** | **22.7 MB** | **-12.7 MB** |

The event trace proves the old peak was a temporary overlap, not a retained
steady owner:

| Event | Before RED-06 WS / peak / allocator live | After RED-06 WS / peak / allocator live |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| after reverse dictionary parse | 42.8 / 42.8 / 16.4 MB | 42.6 / 42.6 / 16.4 MB |
| after reverse advanced merge drop | n/a | 26.1 / 42.6 / 3.7 MB |
| after table advanced payload parse | 53.8 / 53.8 / 16.4 MB | 37.0 / 42.6 / 3.7 MB |
| after compact table store parse | 70.3 / 79.6 / 27.7 MB | 53.4 / 62.9 / 14.9 MB |
| after `normal_codes` HashSet | 56.5 / 79.6 / 16.1 MB | 56.3 / 62.9 / 16.1 MB |

RED-06 closes the peak blocker for the current lean keyboard proxy against the
64 MB hard budget on this Windows harness. It does **not** close M47: steady is
still **58.0 MB**, about **1.21x** over the 48 MB target. The next measured
branch should target steady retained data after the compact parse, especially
the `normal_codes` HashSet and unnamed compact-table descriptor heap, not
allocator decay.

## RED-07 comments-intact lookup storage closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-29)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red07-comments-2026-06-29/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red07-comments-2026-06-29/)
from the same native probe. These are Windows `WorkingSetSize` / `PrivateUsage`
measurements, not iOS `phys_footprint`.

RED-07 responds to the product-profile correction from TypeDuck-iOS: rich
candidate comments are part of the dictionary UX, so the old **58 MB** lean row
is only a lower bound. TypeDuck-iOS reference evidence in the RED-07 bundle
shows RIME candidate comments carry the multilingual dictionary payload, Swift
parses visible/opened candidate comments, and English/Unihan/ngram support
stores are separate data. RED-07 therefore keeps rich comments and removes their
heap retention by indexing the compiled `YUNE-LOOKUP` payload instead of eagerly
retaining `HashMap<String, Vec<DictionaryLookupRecord>>`.

| Profile | Before steady / peak | After RED-07 steady / peak | After private | After allocator live | Rich comments |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Lean lower bound | **56.7 / 61.8 MB** | **56.9 / 61.3 MB** | **23.3 MB** | **16.0 MB** | omitted |
| Comments-intact keyboard | **164.0 / 171.2 MB** | **78.7 / 89.1 MB** | **33.7 MB** | **25.6 MB** | retained |
| Full mobile | **194.0 / 201.3 MB** | **91.4 / 102.4 MB** | **41.6 MB** | **32.3 MB** | retained |

The owner movement is direct:

| Profile | Before lookup owners | After lookup owners |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Comments-intact keyboard | `82,615,735 B` `heap_owned_required` | `31,717,345 B` `shared_or_overlapping` byte-backed payload rows |
| Full mobile | `96,384,893 B` `heap_owned_required` | `37,253,867 B` `shared_or_overlapping` byte-backed payload rows |

Representative `zouhapci` candidates in
[`rich-comments/rich-comment-zouhapci.json`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red07-comments-2026-06-29/rich-comments/rich-comment-zouhapci.json)
retain `\f\r1,` TypeDuck dictionary-panel bytes after the storage change.

RED-07 verdict: the removed bulk was live retained lookup/comment heap, not
allocator-retained free memory. The byte-backed path preserves rich comments and
turns the lookup payload into shared/overlapping compiled bytes plus a small
index. M47 is still not closed: comments-intact keyboard remains above both the
48 MB steady target and the 64 MB peak hard budget on this Windows proxy, and
full mobile remains higher because it also keeps the grave-prefix reverse UI
path. No iOS-ready claim is made.

## Phase 0 attribution refresh (Windows-measured, 2026-06-29)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-phase0-refresh-2026-06-29/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-phase0-refresh-2026-06-29/)
reruns the Phase 0 style owner split on current `main` after RED-07, without
starting a reduction branch. The probe is still Windows
`PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS_EX.WorkingSetSize` / `PrivateUsage` plus the test-local
allocator wrapper, not iOS `phys_footprint`.

| Profile | Steady WS | Peak WS | Private | Alloc live / high | Named owners | Heap named | Clean mmap estimate | Shared/overlap lookup rows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Comments-intact keyboard | **82.8 MB** | **94.5 MB** | **33.6 MB** | **25.6 / 59.9 MB** | `73,092,720 B` | `4,195,278 B` | `34,602,818 B` | `31,717,345 B` |
| Full mobile | **92.9 MB** | **103.7 MB** | **41.5 MB** | **32.3 / 59.9 MB** | `86,124,829 B` | `4,856,616 B` | `40,740,505 B` | `37,253,867 B` |

Refresh verdict: the old Phase 0 conclusion still holds, and the current
post-RED-07 profile has no large allocator-retained/free-memory bucket.
`PrivateUsage` is already below the 48 MB steady target for both current
profiles, while working set and peak remain over target. The remaining measured
blocker is resident mapped/shared compiled data and compact lookup/index/payload
footprint. The full-mobile double dictionary load is confirmed as primary
`jyut6ping3` plus secondary `luna_pinyin_yune_reverse`; the secondary/reverse
dictionary is for grave-prefix Mandarin reverse UI behavior, not normal
unprefixed Jyutping candidate generation. The separate
`dictionary_lookup_filter.lookup_records` owner from `jyut6ping3_scolar` is
dictionary-panel/comment enrichment, not plain candidate text generation.

## RED-08 compact lookup/code-index closeout (Windows-measured, 2026-06-29)

Evidence:
[`evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red08-2026-06-29/`](./evidence/m47-ios-budget-native-memory-reduction-red08-2026-06-29/).
RED-08 keeps rich TypeDuck comments and normal Jyutping typing behavior. It
sets `translator/load_lookup_records: false` for the mobile profile's primary
translator, keeps `dictionary_lookup_filter` comment enrichment, replaces the
compact-table `all_codes()` -> `normal_codes` `HashSet<String>` with
storage-backed compact-table code lookup, and preserves reuse of the large
primary/reverse prebuilt prisms with order-preserving checksum normalization for
runtime-only lookup gates. It does **not** close all startup hygiene:
`jyut6ping3_scolar` still rebuilds its tiny prism during deploy, producing the
remaining near-80 MB deploy peak in this Windows proxy.

| Profile | Before RED-08 steady / peak | After RED-08 steady / peak | After private | After allocator live / high | Named owners | Heap named | Clean mmap estimate | Shared/overlap rows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Comments-intact keyboard | **82.8 / 94.5 MB** | **67.4 / 80.1 MB** | **22.5 MB** | **16.3 / 59.9 MB** | `58,873,628 B` | `4,195,278 B` | `34,602,818 B` | `20,073,545 B` |
| Full mobile | **92.9 / 103.7 MB** | **78.8 / 89.9 MB** | **28.1 MB** | **22.1 / 59.9 MB** | `71,905,737 B` | `4,856,616 B` | `40,740,505 B` | `26,306,629 B` |

RED-08 removed the measured primary `compact_table.lookup_records` retention
row: `14,219,092 B` from both product profiles. For the comments-intact keyboard
profile, the remaining top owners are `dictionary_lookup_filter.lookup_records`
(`17,498,253 B`, rich comment lookup payload), `compact_table.storage`
(`15,248,382 B`, mmap/file-backed primary table), `prism.spelling_map`
(`10,965,828 B`), `prism.double_array_units` (`8,388,608 B`), and
`compact_table.syllabary_codes` (`4,189,674 B`, heap). Full mobile remains
higher because it also keeps the secondary grave-prefix reverse UI lookup
payload (`compact_table.lookup_records` `5,536,522 B`) and table/prism storage.

RED-08 verdict: this is a real product-profile reduction, but M47 is still not
closed. The remaining gap is dominated by clean/file-backed and
shared/overlapping compiled assets, not allocator-retained free memory. The next
branch should target compiled asset/profile slimming and compact payload/index
format; startup hygiene still has the measured `jyut6ping3_scolar` prism rebuild
blocker. Do not claim iOS readiness until the later on-device
`phys_footprint`/`vmmap` gate.

## Verdict (Windows-measured)

Against the 64 MB hard budget, the original isolated `jyut6ping3_mobile` baseline
was **~4.7x over** the 48 MB steady target and **~3.6x over** the 64 MB peak
target. After RED-08, the lean lower-bound run is still **~1.19x over** the
steady target but is **under** the 64 MB peak hard budget on the Windows proxy.
The comments-intact keyboard proxy is **~1.41x over** the steady target and
**~1.25x over** the 64 MB peak hard budget; full mobile is **~1.64x over**
steady and **~1.40x over** peak. Cangjie5 remains ~1.5x over at steady;
luna_pinyin is borderline-under at steady but ~4.6x over at peak. Even a
small-schema base is ~60-95 MB before profile-specific UI deferral. The
memory-light Jyutping lower bound and the comments-intact keyboard profile
**do not fit the 48 MB steady target** in their current shape, and closing the
remaining gap remains
**architecture-level work, not tuning**. The portable levers (bound transients,
slim the mobile profile, then revisit remaining named heap) are
Windows-implementable and benefit every platform. **No
"iOS-ready" claim** until a later real-Apple-device validation pass.

## Next work

RED-01 through RED-08 are complete. Start the next branch with compiled
asset/profile slimming and compact payload/index format. For the comments-intact
keyboard profile, the first measured blocker is now the remaining
shared/overlapping compiled lookup/table payload and mmap/file-backed table/prism
footprint, not eager lookup-record heap. Keep both steady and peak visible. Do
not use allocator changes as the next branch unless a later allocator-specific
probe shows a steady live-vs-resident gap that Phase
0/RED-01/RED-02/RED-03/RED-04/RED-05/RED-06/RED-07/RED-08 did not show.
