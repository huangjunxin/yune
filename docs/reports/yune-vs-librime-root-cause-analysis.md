# Yune vs upstream librime root-cause dashboard

Date: 2026-06-27

This report explains current M45 and M46 native-engine evidence. It does not
claim browser, frontend, product-delivery, packaging, public-demo, deployment,
WASM, or broad product speed wins; the browser/WASM figures below are recorded
as measured gaps, not wins.

## Current Verdict

M45 closes as a partial native-engine root-cause milestone. It improves the
memory accounting and confirms the short-key behavior guard, but it does not
close the remaining `n`/`ni` short-prefix ratio gap or the real peak-memory
cost. Phase 0 selected `short-key-measured-no-go`, so M45 did not retain a
short-key engine implementation branch.

Measured outcomes:

- `hao` remains inside target at `24.267 us`, `2.110x` same-run upstream
  librime. This preserves the M44 `hao` pass; it is not a new M45 speed win.
- `n` is now the clearest short-prefix blocker: `68.900 us`, `3.313x`.
- `ni` remains a blocker: `49.450 us`, `3.458x`.
- Short-key candidate output for `n`, `ni`, and `hao` matches upstream
  librime `1.17.0`.
- Steady Track A resident memory is below `107,797,708 B`, but first startup
  still records `127,475,712 B` peak working set, so peak memory is not solved.

Latest review snapshot:
[`./evidence/reframed-comparison-review-2026-06-27/`](./evidence/reframed-comparison-review-2026-06-27/).
It confirms the same Track A conclusion with normal run-to-run noise:
`hao 2.199x`, `n 3.534x`, and `ni 3.698x`, with a `128,364,544 B` Track A peak.
Those precise values are recorded only in the run-labeled evidence; public
summary docs use ranges for short-key ratios.

Do not use that snapshot's native Track B rows for product root cause. The run
omitted `-DeployProductBeforeBenchmark`; Track B status is
`compiled_ready=false`, `selected_storage=unavailable`, and
`source_fallback=true`, producing a `510,925,748 B`
`translator.entries_by_code` source-YAML fallback BTreeMap and about `1.05 GB`
peak. M46's byte-backed `source_fallback=false` evidence remains the valid Track
B product memory source.

## M45 Cause Map

| Area | Pre-M45 cause | M45 evidence | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Track A `n` | Post-M44 diagnostic showed the one-letter row as the sharpest short-prefix owner. | Final `68.900 us`, `3.313x`; behavior guard passes; sentence model calls remain `0`. | Target missed; measured benchmark-parity blocker. |
| Track A `ni` | Same short-prefix translator/prefix path remained above target after M44. | Final `49.450 us`, `3.458x`; behavior guard passes; sentence model calls remain `0`. | Target missed; measured benchmark-parity blocker. |
| Track A `hao` | M44 had already reduced surplus short-key work enough to pass the ratio gate. | Final `24.267 us`, `2.110x`; behavior guard passes. | Target met. |
| Track A long rows | M40 full-pinyin sentence lookup path must stay isolated from short-key work. | Final ratios `0.939x` and `0.720x`; no M45 short-key or abbreviation regression recorded. | Guard passed. |
| Track A abbreviations | M42/M44 behavior and bounded-ranking improvements must remain intact. | Final `cszysmsrsd` `0.440x` and `zybfshmsru` `0.640x`, with candidate-output parity preserved. | Guard passed. |
| Track A memory | M43/M44 retained-owner reductions did not explain process peak. | Steady rows are `87-99 MB`; first startup and all rows retain `127,475,712 B` peak. | Resident target met; peak is a standing blocker. |

## Short-Key Root Cause

M45 proves the short-key gap is behavior-comparable: upstream librime and Yune
candidate output match for `n`, `ni`, and `hao`, including first-page text,
comments, order, preedit, commit preview, and page metadata.

The remaining root cause is not the sentence path. Final owner counters show
`upstream_sentence_model_calls=0` and small first-page materialization costs on
the short-key rows:

The `Prefix lookup` and `First-page materialize` columns are sub-operation
times from the metrics-instrumented run, whose total process-key time is higher
than the clean `Yune median` (for example `ni` instruments at `96.900 us`).
They show which owner dominates, not exact shares of the clean median.

| Row | Yune median | Ratio | Prefix lookup | Rows scanned | First-page materialize | Read |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `n` | `68.900 us` | `3.313x` | `35.100 us` | `7` | `1.700 us` | Prefix/translator constant factor still too high. |
| `ni` | `49.450 us` | `3.458x` | `35.600 us` | `14` | `5.200 us` | Prefix/translator constant factor still too high. |
| `hao` | `24.267 us` | `2.110x` | `9.300 us` | `21` | `8.600 us` | Ratio target met. |

M45 does not retain a short-key implementation branch because the explored
bounded table-range experiment did not move the measured target. The final
`n`/`ni` medians should therefore be read as fresh same-run evidence and
candidate-output parity proof, not as optimization progress from M45. The next
slice needs a narrower constant-factor owner before changing the translator
path. Because the misses are tens of microseconds, the blocker is recorded as
benchmark-parity work rather than a perceptible typing UX blocker.

## Memory Root Cause

M45 adds private-byte and peak-pagefile columns to the native benchmark harness
and uses them to split steady resident memory from high-water peak.

| Measurement | Final value | Read |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Session steady working set | `87,498,752 B` | Below resident target. |
| Startup steady working set | `90,161,152 B` | Below resident target. |
| `n` steady working set | `91,058,176 B` | Below resident target. |
| Highest Track A steady row | `98,684,928 B` | Below resident target. |
| Track A max peak working set | `127,475,712 B` | Standing peak-cost blocker. |
| Track A max peak pagefile | `112,218,112 B` | Peak-cost signal. |

The first startup sample starts at `4,722,688 B`, reaches `90,161,152 B` after
ready, finalizes to `87,248,896 B`, and still records `127,475,712 B` peak
working set. That prevents M45 from classifying the high-water value as a pure
benchmark-cumulative artifact.

Retained owner evidence also does not name a new safe peak-moving rewrite:

| Owner | Class | Retained estimate | Read |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `poet.entries_by_code` | heap-owned reducible | `18,694,662 B` | Largest reducible owner, already reduced in M43. |
| `compact_table.storage` | mmap file-backed | `13,013,460 B` | File-backed selected storage, not a heap mirror. |
| `poet.lookup_index` | heap-owned guarded | `2,660,848 B` | Required by M40 performance. |
| Small reducible owners | heap-owned reducible | `30,875 B` | Too small to move process peak. |

M45 therefore closes memory as resident-target success with a standing peak
blocker, not as full memory success.

## Guardrails Preserved

| Gate | M45 final evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Startup/session | Startup `0.875x`, session `0.921x` same-run librime; no startup/session speed claim. |
| `zhongguo` | `61.225 us`, `0.373x` same-run librime. |
| M40 long rows | `0.939x` and `0.720x`; full-pinyin path remains separate. |
| M42/M44 abbreviations | `0.440x` and `0.640x`; candidate-output guard remains preserved. |
| Short-key output | `n`, `ni`, and `hao` match upstream candidate output. |
| Track A storage | `selected_storage=rsmarisa_byte_backed`, table/prism mmap, heap mirrors `0`, `source_fallback=false`, positive `rsmarisa` counters. |
| Track B storage | Deployed profile remains source-fallback-free; M45 makes no Track B speed claim. |

## M46 Track B/Jyutping Memory Attribution

M46 closes as a useful partial result with measured memory blockers. It does
not change the M45 Track A verdict. It attributes the TypeDuck/Jyutping Track B
native memory and the yune-web Jyutping WASM high-water, fixes the
product-affecting multi-schema browser correctness blocker, and stops before a
storage rewrite because the headline memory owner remains mostly unclassified.

Fresh M46 Phase 0 native evidence keeps the Track B product path
source-fallback-free while confirming the headline memory blocker:

| Measurement | Value | Read |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Track B peak working set | `504,627,200 B` | Real high-water remains. |
| Track B steady resident band | `427,356,160-442,966,016 B` | Resident footprint remains large. |
| Track B private bytes proxy | `423,641,088 B` | Private memory is also large. |
| Track B peak pagefile proxy | `535,744,512 B` | Peak pressure is visible outside working set. |

New owner rows explain only part of that headline:

| Owner | Class | Estimate | Read |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `compact_table.lookup_records` | heap-owned required | `31,920,140 B` | Largest named owner; required for dictionary panels. |
| `compact_table.storage` | mmap file-backed | `15,248,382 B` | Base table selected storage, not a heap mirror. |
| `translator.entries_by_code` | heap-owned guarded | `8,327,700 B` | Guarded/source-YAML or small-test state. |
| `compact_table.syllabary_codes` | heap-owned reducible | `4,189,674 B` | Too small to justify a headline `rsmarisa` branch. |
| candidate text/comment payload | shared/overlapping | `2,575,292 B` | Visible but overlapping and small. |

M46 Phase 0 therefore did not authorize a Track B `rsmarisa`, payload, scolar,
reverse-index, or transient memory optimization branch. It selected
`schema-switch-regression-fix-first`, because browser evidence showed
Cangjie -> Luna -> Jyutping returning zero Jyutping candidates in a current
post-WEB-01 multi-schema session.

Branch A fixed that correctness blocker. Post-fix browser evidence shows clean
Jyutping, Cangjie -> Luna -> Jyutping, and Jyutping -> Luna -> Jyutping all
return `nei -> 你` with six candidates, zero worker action errors, and the same
`893.1 MiB` WASM high-water.

![M46 Branch A browser memory and correctness](./evidence/m46-jyutping-native-wasm-memory-attribution/m46-branch-a-browser-memory.svg)

M46 therefore records `schema-switch-correctness-fixed-memory-unchanged` and
`measured-no-go-owner-unclassified`. No native Track B or browser WASM memory
success is claimed.

## Memory Synthesis: M43-M46

Four milestones attacked memory and the headline never moved. That convergence
is itself the finding:

- The **structural-owner approach is exhausted.** Named owners explain at most
  about `12%` of the Track B peak (`~60 MB` of `~504 MB`), and the easy
  hypotheses are measured-dead: a Jyutping `rsmarisa` string table saves
  `~4 MB`, not `~200 MB`; candidate text/comment payloads are `~2.5 MB`
  combined; `jyut6ping3_scolar` is mmap source bytes, not a retained owner.
  There is no large reducible structure left to refactor, and M43 already proved
  that shrinking a named owner (`poet.entries_by_code`, `-19.5 MB`) does not
  move process peak.
- The browser headline is most likely an **init-transient, not a resident
  owner.** Browser Jyutping stays at `893.1 MiB` regardless of loaded asset
  bytes (`0 B` extras through `26 MB` full Jyutping all reach the same
  high-water), JS heap is only `5-6 MB`, and Emscripten linear memory never
  shrinks below the peak reached during schema initialization. The heap most
  likely spikes during Jyutping init and is then stuck; steady-state *need* may
  be far lower (Luna settles at `160 MiB`).
- The cross-engine browser comparison is **not like-for-like**, so the size of
  any Yune inefficiency is unquantified. The librime-based My RIME browser build
  runs Jyutping in `68 MiB`, but on the Cantonese-only
  [`rime-cantonese`](https://github.com/rime/rime-cantonese) dictionary. Yune runs
  TypeDuck's `jyut6ping3`, which also carries English, Hindi, Urdu, and Nepali
  entries and is a much larger dataset. So `68 MiB` is **not** a valid target, and
  part of the `893 MiB` is a legitimately bigger dictionary. The init-transient
  evidence above still implies *some* inefficiency — the high-water does not scale
  with loaded asset bytes — and the fair same-schema baseline below quantifies it.
- **The fair same-schema baseline gives the answer: ~10x.** On `luna_pinyin` —
  same schema, same dictionary, no multilingual confound — Yune is roughly `10x`
  heavier than a librime-family engine both natively (`127 MB` vs librime
  `13-17 MB`) and in the browser (`160 MiB` vs My RIME `16 MiB`). So the memory
  inefficiency is **real and ~10x**, independent of any Jyutping dictionary
  difference; the Jyutping `893 MiB` is that ~10x base inefficiency plus a larger
  multilingual dictionary on top. The Jyutping number is therefore a guard, not a
  comparison, and the clean target for any memory work is the fair `luna_pinyin`
  gap.

The next memory step, if pursued, is therefore **init-time allocation high-water
profiling targeting the fair `luna_pinyin` gap** — which initialization phase
spikes the heap, and why a librime-family engine fits the same schema in ~10x
less. Another structural-owner pass is not the move; M43-M46 proved that dry.
This is recorded as future work; M46 changes no memory code.
