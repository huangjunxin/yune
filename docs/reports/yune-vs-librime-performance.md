# Current Yune Performance Dashboard

Date: 2026-06-30

This dashboard shows the current benchmark state only. Older milestone closeout
narrative and superseded benchmark rows remain in
[`history/2026-06-28-yune-vs-librime-performance-pre-current-dashboard.md`](./history/2026-06-28-yune-vs-librime-performance-pre-current-dashboard.md).

The native Track A lane was refreshed by the M52 final same-run benchmark on
2026-06-30. The browser lane is carried forward from the 2026-06-28 Playwright
run and was not re-measured in this pass.

## Technical Summary

- **Native fair lane (`luna_pinyin`)**: the final M52 run records startup near
  parity at `1.113x` and session create/select/destroy at `1.001x` versus
  same-run upstream librime 1.17.0. The tracked key rows are guarded by the
  committed M52 threshold artifact and the final regression gate passes.
- **Native latency disposition**: `n` (`2.818x`), `hao` (`2.146x`), and the
  59-character row (`2.247x`) are inside the strict `<=3.0x` ratio target.
  `ni` (`3.143x`, `30.650 us` absolute gap) and the 37-character row
  (`3.053x`, `601.967 us` absolute gap) remain just above the strict ratio
  target and are closed by M52 as bounded-microsecond ceilings, not as product
  launch blockers.
- **Native Track A memory**: the final Track A high-water is
  `188,383,232 B` (`188.4 MB`) versus librime's `17,276,928 B` max peer peak in
  the same run. This full `luna_pinyin` preset-vocabulary shape is a comparison
  lane, not the current native TypeDuck product profile, and is now protected by
  the M52 `198,000,000 B` ceiling gate. It is separate from the M47
  `jyut6ping3_mobile` iOS-keyboard proxy.
- **Browser fair lane (`luna_pinyin`, carried 2026-06-28)**: Yune public demo
  uses `64.0 MiB` WASM peak versus My RIME `16.0 MiB` (`4.0x`). Yune is slower
  to ready (`1000 ms` vs `634 ms`), but faster on first input (`74 ms` vs
  `95 ms`).
- **Browser Jyutping (carried 2026-06-28)**: Yune public demo is byte-backed at
  `160.0 MiB` WASM peak. This remains a guard row, not a fair peer comparison,
  because My RIME's Jyutping uses a different Cantonese-only dictionary.

## Native Track A

| Dimension | Yune median | librime median | Yune / librime | Current read |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| startup | `24,139.200 us` | `21,686.900 us` | `1.113x` | near parity |
| session | `23,404.000 us` | `23,390.700 us` | `1.001x` | parity |
| `n` | `60.300 us` | `21.400 us` | `2.818x` | strict ratio pass; threshold pass |
| `ni` | `44.950 us` | `14.300 us` | `3.143x` | bounded-microsecond ceiling; threshold pass |
| `hao` | `24.967 us` | `11.633 us` | `2.146x` | strict ratio pass; threshold pass |
| 37-char pinyin | `895.178 us` | `293.211 us` | `3.053x` | bounded-microsecond ceiling; threshold pass |
| 59-char pinyin | `1,545.754 us` | `687.795 us` | `2.247x` | strict ratio pass; threshold pass |

## Native Track A Guardrail

| Guard | Observed | Ceiling | Status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `n` latency ratio | `2.818x` | `3.050x` | pass |
| `ni` latency ratio | `3.143x` | `3.223x` | pass |
| `hao` latency ratio | `2.146x` | `2.287x` | pass |
| 37-char latency ratio | `3.053x` | `3.267x` | pass |
| 59-char latency ratio | `2.247x` | `2.447x` | pass |
| Track A peak working set | `188,383,232 B` | `198,000,000 B` | pass |

The gate is run by
`scripts/benchmark-native-rime-inprocess.ps1 -TrackAThresholds <thresholds> -FailOnRegression`.
M52 intentionally did not add retained heap indexes or widen ABI surfaces.

## Native Track A Memory

| Measurement | Current value | Current read |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Yune Track A peak working set | `188.4 MB` | comparison-lane high-water, now guardrailed |
| librime max peer peak | `17.3 MB` | same-run peer scale |
| Maximum Track A private-bytes proxy | `194.3 MB` | Windows proxy, not iOS `phys_footprint` |
| `poet.vocabulary` | `53.6 MB` | full upstream Luna preset vocabulary retained on heap |
| `poet.entries_by_code` | `18.7 MB` | upstream sentence-model entries retained on heap |
| Process unclassified lower bound | `105.6 MB` | measured process proxy after named owner accounting |

Native Track A `luna_pinyin` is kept as the upstream comparison lane. The current
native product target remains the TypeDuck/Jyutping profile lane, where M47's
lean probe reports the comments-intact keyboard profile at about `67 MB` working
set / `22 MB` private. These are separate lanes and are not interchangeable
memory claims.

## Browser Peer Dashboard

Carried forward from the 2026-06-28 Playwright run.

| Scenario | Schema | Ready | Input -> candidate | Commit | WASM peak | Unique encoded resources | Validity |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Yune public demo | `luna_pinyin` | `1000 ms` | `74 ms` | `107 ms` | `64.0 MiB` | `29.5 MiB` | fair |
| My RIME live | `luna_pinyin` | `634 ms` | `95 ms` | `119 ms` | `16.0 MiB` | `8.5 MiB` | fair |
| Yune public demo | Jyutping | `1347 ms` | `103 ms` | `108 ms` | `160.0 MiB` | `72.2 MiB` | guard only |
| My RIME live | Jyutping | `998 ms` | `99 ms` | `114 ms` | `68.0 MiB` | `24.9 MiB` | guard only |

## Remaining Current Gaps

| Rank | Gap | Current value | Next diagnostic target |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Browser `luna_pinyin` memory | `64.0 MiB` vs My RIME `16.0 MiB` | WASM runtime floor and public-demo resource/heap split |
| 2 | Browser `luna_pinyin` startup | `1000 ms` vs My RIME `634 ms` | startup asset/runtime phases after current public-demo build |
| 3 | Native Track A full-Luna memory watch | `188.4 MB` vs librime max peer peak `17.3 MB`; M52 ceiling `198.0 MB` | future owner work only if native Luna becomes a shipping product profile |
| 4 | Native `ni` latency watch | `44.950 us` vs `14.300 us`; threshold ceiling `3.223x` | bounded exact-row scan under charset filtering, no retained heap prefix index |
| 5 | Native 37-char latency watch | `895.178 us` vs `293.211 us`; threshold ceiling `3.267x` | preset-vocabulary sentence-model graph cost, no parity-risk shortcut |
