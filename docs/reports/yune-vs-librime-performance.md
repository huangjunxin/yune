## Public summary

M33 corrected the unfair `luna_pinyin` comparison by lazy-loading the `stroke`
reverse lookup and sharing built dictionary translators across compatible schema
selects. M34 then landed a narrower first-page candidate-pipeline optimization.
M35 replaced the upstream `luna_pinyin` heap-expanded spelling-algebra storage
hot path with compact table storage plus prism canonical-code lookup. M36 then
separated fair upstream comparison from the shipped TypeDuck product path and
made `jyut6ping3_mobile` run from rebuilt Yune-readable compiled table/prism
assets instead of the stale unsupported shipped marisa blobs.

The safe public claim is still conservative:

- Yune is no longer measuring luna-plus-stroke startup against luna-only librime.
- M35 materially improved the upstream `luna_pinyin` compact-storage path.
- M36 is the TypeDuck product-path result: `jyut6ping3_mobile` final rows run
  from fresh compiled Yune table/prism/reverse artifacts with `compiled_ready =
  true`, not `SourceFallback`.
- Track B product typing rows improve materially: `ngohaig` `14,943.043 us` ->
  `3,465.057 us` (`-76.8%`), `loengjathau` `16,309.045 us` -> `3,754.855 us`
  (`-77.0%`), and `jigaajiusihaa` `27,633.869 us` -> `5,065.308 us`
  (`-81.7%`).
- Track B product median working set drops by about `80-83 MB` on the measured
  rows; max peak working set drops from `1000.4 MB` to `885.3 MB`.
- Track A upstream `luna_pinyin` still trails librime widely on fair per-key
  comparison rows and working-set gap. These ratios are not the TypeDuck product
  typing headline.
- No browser startup, browser typing, WASM, React, Cloudflare, or TypeDuck-Web
  delivery win is claimed from M36 because runtime/browser-visible files did not
  change.

Final M36 Track A fair upstream comparison:

- `hao`: Yune `4,072.000 us`, librime `11.700 us`; Yune is `348.03x` slower.
- `ni`: Yune `2,977.300 us`, librime `14.450 us`; Yune is `206.04x` slower.
- `zhongguo`: Yune `4,403.738 us`, librime `178.600 us`; Yune is `24.66x` slower.
- Session create/select/destroy: Yune `47,112.900 us`, librime `22,852.100 us`; Yune is `2.06x` slower.
- Warm startup/runtime-ready: Yune `48,144.900 us`, librime `22,105.300 us`; Yune is `2.18x` slower.
- Median working set: Yune `158-161 MB` on the Track A rows, librime about
  `10-13 MB`; Yune max peak is `171.8 MB` versus librime about `14.1 MB`.

M35's memory win was dictionary-specific, not whole-process peak. M36's product
path reduces TypeDuck product working set, but Track A still shows a large
whole-process gap versus librime.

## Diagnosis After M36

The remaining gap is not one bug and it is not "Rust is slow." M33-M36 removed
several large, real costs, but Yune is still a hybrid design: some paths now use
compact table/prism lookup, while other compatibility paths still allocate owned
candidate payloads, enumerate full lists, sort/filter full lists, clone context
snapshots, and read compiled assets into owned memory before parsing them. By
contrast, librime's mature classic path is built around mapped deployed assets,
shared dictionary/table objects, lazy translation iterators, page-oriented
candidate production, and lazy reverse lookup.

The final M36 evidence therefore has two very different shapes:

| Surface | Current result | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Track A startup/session | Yune is `2.06-2.18x` slower than librime | M33 cache/fairness and M35 compact storage moved schema lifecycle into the same order of magnitude. |
| Track A short keys | Yune is `206.04x` slower on `ni` and `348.03x` slower on `hao` | The remaining hot path is no longer just dictionary load; it is frontend-shaped key processing plus full candidate/context work. |
| Track A `zhongguo` | Yune is `24.66x` slower | Longer input benefits more from M35 compact storage, but still pays full-list and owned-output costs. |
| Track A working set | Yune is about `12-14x` larger by median working-set rows | Compact storage reduced dictionary-local work, but whole-process memory still includes owned table strings, owned candidates, Rust/ABI runtime state, and non-borrowed compiled data. |
| Track B product path | Product typing rows improve `-29.2%` to `-81.7%` | M36 fixed a product-path waste: stale unsupported TypeDuck blobs forced source fallback before fresh Yune-readable compiled artifacts were rebuilt. |
| Track B `hai` residual | `hai` remains `15,241.000 us`, about `3x` slower than the other final product key rows | This is the sharpest residual latency clue: the shortest, common, ambiguous product input is now the worst row, so completion-set materialization, global sort/filter, userdb merge, and context export are more urgent suspects than long-composition sentence DP. |
| Browser delivery | No M36 claim | Native engine improvements do not automatically reduce TypeDuck-Web startup, WASM memory, React render, or Cloudflare/cache costs. |

The `hai` row should lead the next diagnosis. It improved only `-29.2%` while
`ngohaig`, `loengjathau`, and `jigaajiusihaa` improved `-76.8%` to `-81.7%`.
Because `hai` is the shortest measured product input and still the slowest final
product key row, it contradicts a naive "long input is the bottleneck" story.
The strongest inference is that short ambiguous input still drives a large
completion/homophone set through the eager candidate/context path. That remains
an inference until per-stage Track B attribution proves the exact owner.

### Bottleneck Map

M36 does not yet provide a per-stage percentage breakdown for each key row. The
diagram below is therefore a numbered triage map: row totals, ratios, and memory
anchors are measured, while the owner labels are the current best-supported
hypotheses to be proven by M37 owner spans.

Numeric anchors in the current map:

| Anchor | Measured number | Bottleneck meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Track B `hai` final row | `15.241 ms` median after M36 | Worst final product key row despite being only three keys; it is `3.0-4.4x` slower than the other measured product key rows. |
| Track B peer final rows | `ngohaig` `3.465 ms`, `loengjathau` `3.755 ms`, `jigaajiusihaa` `5.065 ms` | M36 fixed the old product storage/source-fallback waste for most rows; `hai` did not follow the same curve. |
| Track B `hai` improvement | `21.542 ms` -> `15.241 ms` (`-29.2%`) | The shortest row barely moved compared with the `76.8-81.7%` peer-row improvements, pointing away from raw compiled-path selection as the remaining owner. |
| Track B product peak memory | `1000.4 MB` -> `885.3 MB` | Fresh compiled product assets helped, but storage/output state is still much larger than librime-style mapped/borrowed storage would be. |
| Track A short-key latency gap | `ni` `206.04x`, `hao` `348.03x` slower than librime | The comparison path still spends far more than librime on per-key frontend-shaped work even after lookup fixes. |
| Track A working-set gap | Yune `158-161 MB` median rows vs librime `10-13 MB` | Owned/non-byte-backed storage remains a structural memory owner. |

Current evidence-backed bottleneck read:

| Bottleneck area | Evidence status | Why it matters now | M37 proof needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Candidate materialization and context export | Strongly suspected, not yet percentage-attributed | Track B `hai` is the shortest measured input but remains the slowest final key row; `RimeGetContext` currently asks for a full engine snapshot before exporting one page | Count candidates enumerated, owned candidates built, candidates cloned by snapshot, and C strings exported per key |
| Full-list sort/filter/userdb/ranker work | Strongly suspected for product rows | Outside the narrow `luna_pinyin` bounded gate, `Engine::refresh_candidates` still collects and sorts a full `Vec<Candidate>`, then merges predictive userdb rows and filters/rankers | Split `hai` time across lookup, materialization, sort/top-K, filters, userdb merge, and rankers |
| `rsmarisa` / byte-backed product storage | Confirmed missing capability | M36 made the product compiled-active by re-emitting no-marisa Yune-readable assets, but the real product marisa string-table path is still not active | Prove `rsmarisa` parses real `jyut6ping3` / `jyut6ping3_scolar` table data and is selected by runtime product loads |
| Owned compact storage and whole-process memory | Measured remaining gap | Track A working set remains about `12-14x` librime even after compact storage; current stores still own strings and candidate payloads | Attribute working set by table bytes, parsed storage, candidates/context, userdb, reverse lookup, ABI buffers, and allocator high-water |
| Browser delivery | Not measured by M36 | Native engine changes do not automatically reduce WASM startup, asset fetch, worker serialization, React paint, or Cloudflare cache behavior | M31/M37 browser-specific evidence only after rebuilt release WASM and real browser runs |

Residual-row heat map:

| Row / surface | Measured symptom | Bottleneck signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Track B `hai` | `21,541.967 us` -> `15,241.000 us` (`-29.2%`) | Worst final product key row despite shortest input; strongest signal for eager completion-set materialization, full-list merge, and context export. |
| Track B `ngohaig` | `14,943.043 us` -> `3,465.057 us` (`-76.8%`) | M36 compiled-product path fixed the old source-fallback/storage waste for this row. |
| Track B `loengjathau` | `16,309.045 us` -> `3,754.855 us` (`-77.0%`) | Long product row benefits from compiled-active storage; remaining cost is much lower than `hai`. |
| Track B `jigaajiusihaa` | `27,633.869 us` -> `5,065.308 us` (`-81.7%`) | Long row no longer looks like the dominant blocker after M36. |
| Track A short keys | `ni` `206.04x`, `hao` `348.03x` slower than librime | Short-key comparison remains dominated by frontend-shaped key/context work, not only table lookup. |
| Track A working set | Yune `158-161 MB` median rows vs librime `10-13 MB` | Owned/non-byte-backed storage and runtime/output state remain structurally larger than librime's mapped table/prism path. |

Target bottleneck shape after M37:

This is an expected post-fix shape, not a post-fix measurement. It separates
two M37 gates: the expected `hai` latency win comes from page-bounded
candidate/context export, while `rsmarisa` is a hard storage/data-path gate
needed to match librime's byte-backed shape. Do not treat `rsmarisa` as the
measured `hai` owner unless Phase 0 attribution proves it.

Librime reference pipeline:

This is the structural pipeline M37 is trying to match at the data-path level.
It is not a claim that Yune should clone librime's C++ component model; the
target is the same bounded/mapped behavior at the hot path.

M37 target versus librime:

| Pipeline property | Librime shape | M37 target shape | Match status after M37 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deployed dictionary storage | `Table` and `Prism` point into read-only mapped deployed files with compact table indexes and a string table. | `rsmarisa`-backed product table plus byte-backed/native-mapped storage where the platform permits it. | Should match the important storage property if `rsmarisa` is active and Yune stops rebuilding owned heap maps. |
| Lookup result form | Translators return lazy `Translation` streams; table/userdict rows are advanced by `Peek`/`Next`. | Translator returns a candidate view/window or equivalent stream, not an eagerly owned full `Vec<Candidate>` for page reads. | Should match if Task 3 lands page-bounded materialization. |
| Completion handling | `LazyTableTranslation` starts with a small lookup limit and expands only when more candidates are requested. | Product completion should enumerate visible page plus bounded surplus, then grow on paging/full-list demand. | Should match for ordinary page reads; full-list-only TypeDuck features stay explicit eager paths. |
| Merge/filter/menu | `Menu::Prepare(requested)` pulls enough candidates through merged translations and filters for the requested page or index. | Engine merge/sort/filter/userdb/ranker work should be stable top-K/page-window based for the default path. | Should match in shape, even if Yune keeps different Rust internals and TypeDuck-specific filters. |
| Context / ABI export | Page creation and candidate-list iteration request candidates by page/index; they do not require materializing the whole completion set first. | `RimeGetContext` should snapshot/export the visible page before any full-list clone. | This is the hard output-path match M37 must prove with clone/allocation counters. |
| Feature escapes | Sentence making, contextual suggestions, filters, userdict learning, and deeper paging can force more work. | Correction, prediction, sentence, partial selection, learning, and debug/full-list APIs may still force eager expansion. | A controlled mismatch is acceptable only when the evidence tags it as feature-required. |

Reconciliation with the M36 finding: the big M36 product win came from
schema-scoped deploy rebuilding stale unsupported product marisa blobs into
fresh Yune-readable no-marisa compiled artifacts. It did not prove that missing
`rsmarisa` is the current `hai` latency owner. The post-M36 `hai` anomaly points
more directly at eager completion-set materialization, full-list merge/sort,
context snapshot, and ABI export. M37 keeps `rsmarisa` as a hard closeout gate
because matching librime's storage shape still requires real marisa/byte-backed
product data, but Phase 0 decides whether storage or output owns the next
latency win.

Expected M37 before/after interpretation:

| Area | Current measured anchor | Expected M37 state | Closeout proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product lookup storage | Phase-0 product blobs failed with unsupported marisa sections; M36 re-emitted fresh Yune-readable no-marisa assets | Real product `marisa string_table` data parses through `rsmarisa`, and runtime product loads select it | Product status rows show fresh checksums, `compiled_ready=true`, and successful marisa parse/selection for `jyut6ping3` and `jyut6ping3_scolar`. |
| Candidate materialization | `hai` remains `15.241 ms` while peers are `3.465-5.065 ms` | Default product key rows materialize only a visible page plus bounded surplus unless a whole-list feature explicitly requires more | Owner spans report candidates enumerated, owned candidates built, clones, exported strings, and elapsed time per key. |
| Context export | Current `RimeGetContext` path clones a full owned context before exporting one page | Page snapshot/export happens before full-list cloning for default frontend reads | Owner spans show `RimeGetContext` candidate clones and ABI allocations scale with page size, not total completion-set size. |
| `hai` anomaly | Shortest product row, worst final row, only `-29.2%` after M36 | No longer the unexplained worst row; if still slow, the top owner is named with per-stage counters | M37 closeout includes a dedicated `hai` attribution table before and after fixes. |
| Residual work | Track A still has `206-348x` short-key latency gaps and `12-14x` median working-set gaps | Remaining hot boxes are true lookup/index cost, full-list-only correctness features, lifecycle work, or browser delivery | Residual owners are measured separately; browser claims require rebuilt release WASM and real browser evidence. |

### What Is Already Solved

- The old unfair comparison that loaded `stroke` reverse lookup for Yune but not
  for librime is gone. Reverse lookup is now lazy in Yune too.
- Re-selecting compatible schemas no longer rebuilds immutable dictionary
  translators from scratch.
- The upstream `luna_pinyin` path can avoid heap-expanded spelling-algebra alias
  storage when compiled table/prism assets are safe.
- The TypeDuck `jyut6ping3_mobile` product path can now run from fresh
  Yune-readable table/prism/reverse artifacts with `compiled_ready=true`.
- The newer M36 native in-process harness avoids the older managed `.NET` host
  confound for the final Track A/Track B evidence.

### Remaining Root Causes

1. **Compiled assets are still copied into owned memory.** Yune loads compiled
   table, prism, and reverse bytes with `fs::read`, then parses them into owned
   Rust structures. Current `CompactTableStore` still owns `String` codes and
   candidate text. librime opens table and prism files through mapped-file
   machinery, then points its table/prism accessors into that deployed image.
   This is the largest structural reason the Track A working-set rows remain
   about `12-14x` larger than librime.

2. **Compact storage is not yet byte-backed storage.** M35/M36 compact storage
   is a better in-memory representation, not a direct borrowed view of the
   deployed table. It removes the worst expanded-alias heap path, but it still
   copies code/text payloads, builds grouping vectors, and materializes owned
   `Candidate` values at the public engine/API boundary.

3. **The bounded candidate path is deliberately narrow.** Yune's first-page
   bounded refresh is guarded to safe `luna_pinyin` short inputs with no rankers,
   no userdb entries, and only bounded-safe filters. The translator bounded path
   also rejects correction, dynamic lookup, prediction, prefix fallback,
   sentence behavior, and other full-list-sensitive features. This preserves
   behavior, but it means many realistic rows still take the eager path.

4. **The eager path is still full-list shaped.** Outside the bounded subset,
   `Engine::refresh_candidates` collects translator output into a `Vec`, sorts
   the whole list by quality, merges predictive userdb rows, applies filters,
   runs rankers, and stores owned candidates. librime's table translator instead
   exposes lazy translations and fetches more table/user phrases by expanding
   limits only when needed.

5. **Context reads still pay owned-output costs.** The benchmarked key rows are
   frontend-shaped: process each key, then read and free context. Yune stores
   owned `Candidate` values in the context, clones the snapshot for ABI reads,
   then allocates C strings for the visible page. Even when dictionary lookup is
   faster, this output path can dominate short inputs where librime returns one
   page through mature iterator/menu machinery.

6. **TypeDuck-specific correctness features block naive bounding.** Dynamic
   correction can scan all codes; rich dictionary comments are rebuilt per
   candidate; prefix fallback, prediction limits, sentence-over-completion,
   partial selection, default-confirm recomposition, and userdb learning all
   have whole-list or ordering implications. They cannot be bounded by truncating
   results unless first-page, paging, selection, commit, and learning behavior
   are proven byte-identical.

7. **Schema selection still does repeated lifecycle work.** Translator sharing
   removed the largest repeated dictionary rebuild, but schema selection still
   clears and reinstalls processors, translators, filters, and userdb wiring.
   Some engine mutation helpers refresh immediately while selection is still
   assembling state. This is smaller than the old dictionary rebuild but still
   visible in the `2x` startup/session gap.

8. **M36 fixed the product compiled path, not the browser delivery path.** The
   product rows improved because Yune stopped falling back to stale unsupported
   TypeDuck product blobs. That does not change WASM initial memory, selected
   schema asset fetch, worker/main-thread serialization, browser cache behavior,
   or React paint. Those remain M31/public-demo delivery work.

### What Librime Teaches Yune

The useful lessons are data-path lessons, not a mandate to clone librime's C++
component architecture:

- librime's `Table` and `Prism` load deployed files read-only through
  `MappedFile`; their metadata, syllabary, double-array image, table index, and
  string table are used in place rather than copied into a new heap model.
- librime's dictionary component reuses table/prism objects by dictionary and
  prism name, so repeated schema creation shares loaded deployed data.
- librime's table translator uses lazy translation objects. With completion on,
  `LazyTableTranslation` fetches an initial bounded number of user/table entries
  and grows the limit only when the frontend asks for more.
- librime's reverse lookup translator initializes its reverse dictionary on
  first query, not during ordinary no-reverse typing startup.
- librime's table storage uses a string table and compact indexes so repeated
  text/code payloads are not cloned into every runtime candidate.

Yune has adopted the last two ideas partly and the sharing idea partly. The
remaining optimization work is to make the whole hot path page-bounded and
byte-backed without weakening Yune's oracle-driven behavior guarantees.

## Comprehensive Optimization Strategy

The next performance track should be treated as a multi-owner closeout, not a
single trick. Each phase must start from fresh Track A/Track B evidence and
close with either a measured win or a measured no-go.

### Phase 0 - Re-attribute Before Editing

- Keep the M36 native in-process harness as the main native comparison surface.
- Add owner spans for process-key, translator lookup, candidate materialization,
  engine sort/filter/userdb/ranker merge, context snapshot clone, ABI C-string
  allocation/free, and schema-selection mutation/refresh.
- Start with the Track B `hai` row. Split its `15,241.000 us` median across
  lookup, completion enumeration, candidate materialization, global sort, filter
  pipeline, predictive userdb merge, context snapshot, and ABI export before
  touching representation or bounded-pipeline code.
- Add memory attribution that separates mapped/file bytes, parsed table storage,
  candidate/context storage, userdb, sentence model, reverse lookup, ABI
  buffers, and allocator high-water.
- Keep Track A (`luna_pinyin` Yune vs librime) and Track B (`jyut6ping3_mobile`
  Yune before/after) separate in every chart and public claim.

Exit gate: do not start a broad rewrite until the top latency and memory owners
are named per track, and do not generalize from long-input rows until `hai` is
explained. If the top owner is context export rather than lookup, optimize
context export first.

### Phase 1 - Low-Risk Lifecycle And Allocation Wins

- Batch schema-selection mutations so processors/translators/filters/userdb are
  installed first and candidate refresh happens once at the end.
- Avoid context-snapshot and candidate-list cloning when `RimeGetContext` only
  needs the current page.
- Cache formatted dictionary-lookup comment fragments by stable text/code
  inputs where TypeDuck rich-comment bytes are already fixture-locked.
- Replace hot boxed iterator dispatch in `TableStorage` with concrete enum
  iterators if attribution shows dispatch overhead matters.

Exit gate: byte-identical upstream and TypeDuck fixture output, no ABI change,
and measured improvement on the owner that justified the phase.

### Phase 2 - Byte-Backed Compiled Storage

- Build a Yune-owned byte-backed table/prism store that can answer exact,
  prefix, all-code, correction, and lookup-record queries directly from compact
  deployed bytes or a single arena.
- Intern or arena-store repeated code/text/comment payloads so compact entries
  carry ids or offsets, not owned `String` copies.
- Keep public `Candidate` owned at the boundary, but materialize it only for the
  selected page or for explicit full-list APIs.
- Revisit native mmap only after the hot query path can actually borrow from the
  mapped bytes. Mapping bytes and then rebuilding owned heap tables is not a
  win.
- Revisit `rsmarisa` only as a complete table/reverse/prism product strategy,
  not as a table-only shortcut that loses byte-identical TypeDuck semantics.

Exit gate: compact-active schemas must not retain a parallel heap table; memory
evidence must show dictionary/process working-set movement; deploy/rebuild file
lifetime must be safe on Windows.

### Phase 3 - Generalize Page-Bounded Candidate Production

- Expand the bounded request contract past the current `luna_pinyin` short-input
  gate one behavior class at a time.
- For each filter/ranker/userdb feature, classify it as page-safe, surplus-safe,
  or full-list-only. Full-list-only behavior should use measured eager fallback
  rather than a silent behavior change.
- Replace full sort with stable top-K or k-way merge only where first-page and
  paging order are proven byte-identical.
- Make `RimeGetContext` export only the requested page unless a caller uses a
  full-list iterator API.

Exit gate: first page, paging, numbered selection, click selection, deletion,
space/default confirm, partial selection, userdb learning, and debug/inspector
views all remain byte-identical for the target schema.

### Phase 4 - Index The Remaining Full-List Correctness Features

- Replace TypeDuck dynamic-correction all-code scans with length/syllable
  buckets plus restricted-distance scratch reuse.
- Replace sentence/path DP `Vec<String>` path cloning with backpointers or piece
  ids where the sentence path is a measured owner.
- Precompute or index prefix-fallback and prediction-limit metadata so those
  features do not require materializing the whole candidate list just to decide
  the first page.
- Keep `prediction_never_first`, `assign_ordered_candidate_qualities`, and
  sentence-over-completion as explicit stop gates. If their semantics require a
  whole list, the report should say so and leave them eager.

Exit gate: these changes must move long-input or correction-heavy rows without
regressing short ordinary typing or TypeDuck profile fixtures.

### Phase 5 - Browser Delivery Separately

- Treat TypeDuck-Web and future `yune-web` delivery as a separate public-demo
  track. Native mmap does not imply browser demand paging in WASM.
- Measure selected-schema-only asset fetch, content-addressed cache behavior,
  worker startup, WASM memory sizing, response serialization, main-thread state
  application, and React paint separately.
- Claim browser startup or typing wins only after real browser evidence from
  rebuilt release WASM and current app assets.

Exit gate: browser evidence must identify the browser-side owner and show
before/after movement. Native Track B wins alone are not browser wins.

### Near-Term Priority

The next best slice is not another comparison-only micro-optimization. The
highest-leverage order is:

1. Attribute final M36 Track A/Track B per-key rows down to lookup,
   materialization, engine merge, context export, and ABI allocation, starting
   with the Track B `hai` row.
2. If context export or candidate ownership dominates short keys, make the
   current-page export path page-bounded before changing storage again.
3. If dictionary storage still dominates memory, build byte-backed Yune-native
   table/prism storage with offsets/ids and no retained heap mirror.
4. If TypeDuck long-input or correction rows dominate, add correction/sentence
   indexes before generalizing bounded TypeDuck candidate windows.
5. Only after native product rows move should M31-style browser delivery work
   translate those gains into a public web experience.

Safe public wording after this diagnosis:

> Yune has closed several self-inflicted startup and product-path costs, but it
> is still not architecturally as lazy or byte-backed as librime. The remaining
> gap is primarily full-list and owned-output work on top of owned compact
> storage, not a single missing cache. The next optimization track should make
> the hot path page-bounded and byte-backed while preserving oracle-locked
> candidate behavior.

## M36 Product-Path Results

Track B `jyut6ping3_mobile` product before/after medians:

| Row | Baseline median | M36 final median | Change | Baseline working set | Final working set | Working-set change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| startup ready | `201,811.100 us` | `175,424.800 us` | `-13.1%` | `818.7 MB` | `738.8 MB` | `-79.9 MB` |
| session create/select/destroy | `243,946.900 us` | `219,919.200 us` | `-9.8%` | `806.7 MB` | `726.6 MB` | `-80.2 MB` |
| `hai` key sequence | `21,541.967 us` | `15,241.000 us` | `-29.2%` | `822.9 MB` | `741.5 MB` | `-81.4 MB` |
| `ngohaig` key sequence | `14,943.043 us` | `3,465.057 us` | `-76.8%` | `823.2 MB` | `741.5 MB` | `-81.7 MB` |
| `loengjathau` key sequence | `16,309.045 us` | `3,754.855 us` | `-77.0%` | `823.7 MB` | `741.5 MB` | `-82.2 MB` |
| `jigaajiusihaa` key sequence | `27,633.869 us` | `5,065.308 us` | `-81.7%` | `824.8 MB` | `741.5 MB` | `-83.2 MB` |

Product path status changed from stale/unsupported shipped blobs to fresh
Yune-readable compiled assets:

| Dictionary | Baseline status | M36 final status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jyut6ping3` with prism `jyut6ping3_mobile` | stale product `.table.bin`, unsupported `marisa string_table`, unsupported prism/reverse, `compiled_ready=false` | fresh rebuilt table, `jyut6ping3_mobile.prism.bin`, reverse, all parse `ok`, `compiled_ready=true` |
| `jyut6ping3_scolar` | stale product `.table.bin`, unsupported `marisa string_table`, unsupported prism/reverse, `compiled_ready=false` | fresh rebuilt table, prism, reverse, all parse `ok`, `compiled_ready=true` |

The selected M36 product strategy is the no-marisa re-emitted asset fallback.
The `rsmarisa` strategy stays closed by measured no-go because the actual
product blobs must preserve table, reverse, and prism semantics together; using
the original unsupported marisa table alone does not give Yune a byte-identical
runtime path. Native mmap/borrowed storage and browser byte-backed loading stay
future work because compact owned product storage is now active and the remaining
browser/delivery claims need their own real-browser evidence.

## M35 Compact-Storage Results

Startup/storage rows:

| Row | M35 baseline median | M35 after median | Baseline memory delta | After memory delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `startup_trace_luna_pinyin_spelling_algebra_expand` | `148,570.200 us` | `122.200 us` | `17,784,832` | `0` |

Fair cross-engine M35 movement:

| Workload | Yune baseline | Yune after | Change | librime after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `hao` key sequence | `15,906.800 us` | `12,547.200 us` | `-21.1%` | `35.400 us` |
| `ni` key sequence | `9,225.100 us` | `5,678.500 us` | `-38.4%` | `28.700 us` |
| `zhongguo` key sequence | `45,608.600 us` | `35,848.500 us` | `-21.4%` | `1,452.800 us` |

| startup/runtime-ready | `66,709.400 us` | `46,516.200 us` | `-30.3%` | `31,052.200 us` |

M35 does not use the `354x` / `198x` fair-harness per-key ratios as the main
typing headline. Native engine-only/full-ABI rows are the primary M35 engine
movement evidence.

## Visual summary

These charts are generated from the final M36 native in-process evidence bundle,
not from a browser/runtime run. They support native engine-performance,
product-path, and fair cross-engine comparison claims only.

![M36 TypeDuck product latency before and after](./evidence/m36-product-path/m36-product-latency-before-after.svg)

The product latency chart is the M36 achievement view. The shipped
`jyut6ping3_mobile` path no longer depends on the unsupported stale product
marisa blobs at runtime after schema-scoped deploy rebuilds fresh Yune-readable
compiled assets. The strongest typing rows improve by `-76.8%` to `-81.7%`.

![M36 TypeDuck product memory before and after](./evidence/m36-product-path/m36-product-memory-before-after.svg)

The product memory chart is the native product-path footprint view. Median
working set drops by roughly `80-83 MB` on measured Track B rows, and max peak
working set drops by `115.0 MB`.

![M36 final Track A fair Yune versus librime median latency gap](./evidence/m36-product-path/m36-track-a-latency-gap.svg)

The Track A latency chart keeps the unresolved upstream comparison gap visible.
Yune is still `348.03x` slower on `hao`, `206.04x` slower on `ni`, and `24.66x`
slower on `zhongguo` in the fair `luna_pinyin` comparison.

![M36 final Track A working-set gap](./evidence/m36-product-path/m36-track-a-working-set-gap.svg)

The Track A working-set chart is the caveat view. M36 records a product-path
working-set reduction, but it does not solve the fair upstream whole-process
memory gap versus librime.

## Methodology

M33-M35 cross-engine evidence used the same librime-shaped C API harness:
[`../../scripts/yune-vs-librime-benchmark.cs`](../../scripts/yune-vs-librime-benchmark.cs),
driven by [`../../scripts/benchmark-yune-vs-librime.ps1`](../../scripts/benchmark-yune-vs-librime.ps1).
M36 adds a native Rust in-process harness to remove managed/PInvoke overhead
from the product before/after evidence:
[`../../crates/yune-rime-api/benches/native_inprocess_benchmark.rs`](../../crates/yune-rime-api/benches/native_inprocess_benchmark.rs),
driven by
[`../../scripts/benchmark-native-rime-inprocess.ps1`](../../scripts/benchmark-native-rime-inprocess.ps1).

Cross-engine command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\benchmark-yune-vs-librime.ps1 -OutputRoot <evidence-dir> -Iterations 9 -SessionIterations 9 -KeyIterations 25
```

M36 native in-process command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\benchmark-native-rime-inprocess.ps1 -OutputRoot docs\reports\evidence\m36-product-path\phase-4-final -Iterations 5 -SessionIterations 20 -KeyIterations 20 -DeployProductBeforeBenchmark
```

Native benchmark command:

```powershell
cmd /c "cargo bench -p yune-rime-api --bench frontend_baselines > target\m35-frontend-baselines-*.txt 2>&1"
```

The cross-engine rows use the same upstream `luna_pinyin` schema id, the same
shared/user data roots, and the same default module list. M36 Track A keeps that
comparison-only shape. M36 Track B measures Yune before/after for the shipped
TypeDuck `jyut6ping3_mobile` product path and records product asset status. None
of these native rows measure TypeDuck-Web delivery, browser paint, Cloudflare
cache behavior, or public-demo startup.

Yune baseline-to-M34-after movement in the fair cross-engine harness:

| `zhongguo` key sequence | `-1.5%` |

These rows are mixed. They are safe to publish only with the unresolved per-key
gap visible.

### Historical M34 Native Watched Rows

| Row | Before median | M34 after median | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `per_key_real_luna_pinyin_ni_full_abi` | `1,760.250 us` | `1,132.950 us` | `-35.6%` |

| `startup_trace_luna_pinyin_translator_index_build` | `11,657.000 us` | `11,289.000 us` | `-3.2%` |

`per_key_real_luna_pinyin_hao_*` is a new native row added in M34; it has no
same-harness before value. Final after medians are `1,378.800 us` full ABI and
`761.667 us` engine-only.

Engine-only before/after rows are attribution-only because M34 fixed the native
engine-only benchmark to set the real schema id. Full-ABI rows and the
cross-engine harness are the public compare surfaces.

## Interpretation

M34 landed Lever A only:

- internal `CandidateRequest` / `TranslationResult`
- bounded `StaticTableTranslator` request path for the safe subset
- lazy engine candidate-window completion on out-of-window access
- full-list reader preservation for candidate-list iterator APIs
- internal `TableLookup` abstraction implemented for the current heap map

M34 deliberately did not land:

- compiled table query storage
- prism-backed candidate lookup
- mmap/borrowed storage
- browser/runtime delivery work
- TypeDuck profile behavior changes

The remaining performance gap is now better split:

- Native first-page short-prefix context work can be bounded and improved.
- Engine-only lookup is still not close to librime.
- Cold startup and peak memory still need a queryable table/prism representation
  before mmap can pay off.

## Safe public claim

It is safe to say:

> Yune's performance reports now separate native engine work from browser
> delivery, fair upstream comparison from TypeDuck product evidence, and memory
> footprint from latency. M35 removed the upstream `luna_pinyin` heap-expanded
> spelling-algebra owner. M36 makes the shipped TypeDuck `jyut6ping3_mobile`
> path run from fresh Yune-readable compiled table/prism assets and improves the
> measured product typing rows by up to `81.7%`, with median product working set
> down by about `80-83 MB`. Yune still trails librime widely on fair Track A
> `luna_pinyin` per-key comparison rows and working set.

It is not safe to say:

> Yune is faster than librime, Yune uses less memory than librime, Yune browser
> startup or browser typing improved, or the Track A whole-process memory gap is
> solved.
