# Task 0 Target Selection And Data Policy

> **Status:** Complete - **Milestone:** M54 (native octagram grammar support) - **Updated:** 2026-07-01 - **Type:** evidence

## Verdict

Task 0 is complete. The lotem canonical oracle lane, RIME-LMDG validation lane, data licenses, model checksums, schema patch policy, contextual-translation decision, vendoring decision, and milestone numbering decision are pinned well enough to proceed to oracle capture.

M54 is an engine compatibility target because it covers the classic `poet` sentence/lattice grammar scoring path for named schemas. It is not an AI experiment, not a frontend/product request, and not a public performance milestone.

## Schema Patch Decisions

Canonical oracle lane starts from upstream `luna_pinyin` and uses lotem traditional word-oriented grammar data, matching the checked-in traditional-output oracle fixtures:

```yaml
patch:
  __include: grammar:/hant
  translator/contextual_suggestions: false
```

The included `grammar:/hant` config maps to:

```yaml
grammar:
  language: zh-hant-t-essay-bgw
translator/max_homophones: 7
translator/max_homographs: 7
```

Rationale: existing upstream `luna_pinyin` fixtures use traditional output bytes, and the captured M54 oracle rows compare traditional candidate text. The `hant` lane produced observable octagram-dependent movement and is the selected canonical lane for committed M54 fixtures.

RIME-LMDG validation lane uses the documented LTS traditional model with contextual suggestions disabled:

```yaml
patch:
  __include: octagram

octagram:
  __patch:
    grammar:
      language: wanxiang-lts-zh-hant
      collocation_max_length: 6
      collocation_min_length: 3
      collocation_penalty: -14
      non_collocation_penalty: -6
      weak_collocation_penalty: -100
    translator/contextual_suggestions: false
    translator/max_homophones: 8
```

## Contextual Translation Decision

M54 keeps contextual translation out of scope. Oracle capture must use same-session composing candidate behavior and must set `translator/contextual_suggestions: false` for both external lanes. If a future target needs after-commit contextual suggestions, that needs a separate plan and oracle evidence.

## Vendoring Decision

- Do not vendor full lotem `.gram` files into routine Yune fixtures. They are external canonical oracle inputs pinned by branch commit and SHA-256. Commit oracle output bytes and fixture manifests instead.
- Do not vendor RIME-LMDG LTS `.gram` files. The selected validation assets are about 420 MB each and are CC-BY-4.0 with attribution obligations. Pin release URL/digest, record the explicit amzxyz/RIME-LMDG attribution notice, and commit output evidence instead.
- Yune-owned unit tests should use generated synthetic tiny `.gram` data for parser/scoring tests. Synthetic fixtures must be generated from Yune code or checked-in Yune-owned bytes, not copied from third-party `.gram` models.

## M54 Numbering

The live roadmap had a tentative M54 native Track A memory-research candidate and no active numbered engine milestone. M54 is adopted for octagram because it is now the concrete named compatibility target. Track A memory research moved to the tentative M55 candidate during closeout.

## No-Go Review

No Task 0 no-go fired:

- The lotem canonical oracle stack is pinned and reproducible from public commits and model checksums.
- The RIME-LMDG validation stack is pinned from the `LTS` release asset digests and repository license.
- Model-data licenses were verified from current `LICENSE` files.
- The vendoring policy avoids committing large third-party model files.
- The implementation path remains clean-room and native-Rust; plugin source is oracle/build reference only.
- Public C ABI changes remain out of scope.
