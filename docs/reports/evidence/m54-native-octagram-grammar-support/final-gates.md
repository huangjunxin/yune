# M54 Final Gates

Date: 2026-07-01.

Scope: native octagram-compatible grammar support for the named upstream
`luna_pinyin` target. This is not evidence for the librime C++ plugin ABI,
contextual translation, Lua/predict/proto, browser/package behavior, platform
frontends, AI ranking, or public performance claims.

## Follow-Up Review Fixes

The initial M54 commit was not mergeable until OCTA-1/OCTA-2 and clippy review
findings were fixed. The follow-up changed `OctagramGrammar::query` to mirror
upstream `Octagram::Query`: empty context returns `non_collocation_penalty`
before any rear `$` lookup. It also adds the executable synthetic librime
oracle fixture above, refreshes fixture provenance with capture commands, and
cleans the clippy `-D warnings` issues in octagram and Darts byte-key code.

## Canonical Oracle Verification

The ignored local verification harness under `target/m54-native-octagram/`
loaded the pinned upstream `luna_pinyin` dictionary/vocabulary, external
`.gram` models, and the M54 `OctagramGrammar` implementation. The committed
machine-readable summary is `phase-3-yune-core-verification.json`.

The canonical lotem lane used `zh-hant-t-essay-bgw.gram` from
`lotem/rime-octagram-data`. The produced ignored full report hash is:

`18521c346272a998f816011fd891bfa1275eeae48b008f24465c6acfb3ed74e7`

The RIME-LMDG validation lane used `wanxiang-lts-zh-hant.gram` from the LTS
release. The produced ignored full report hash is:

`5e4b1daa1141be5d8b0634a87b0ba5d82db88ed4e472723710825e8898c854c3`

The accepted gate compares the top candidate for each committed oracle row
because Yune still has known non-M54 table/menu ordering differences outside the
octagram grammar provider. All seven lotem rows and all nine RIME-LMDG rows
matched. The full reports remain intentionally ignored:
`target/m54-native-octagram/yune-core-verify-lotem-integrated.json` and
`target/m54-native-octagram/yune-core-verify-rime-lmdg-integrated.json`.

## M52 Guardrail Decision

The M52 native Track A benchmark gate was not rerun. M54 changes sentence
scoring only when an explicit octagram grammar model is loaded. Schemas without
`.gram` keep the existing `NullGrammar` path, and
`cargo test -p yune-core --test upstream_luna_pinyin_parity` passed after the
change. No M52 tracked null-grammar Track A row was intentionally changed.

## Memory And Scope

M54 records octagram retained bytes separately through the
`poet.octagram_double_array` memory-owner row when an octagram grammar provider
is attached. No timing or memory number here is a public performance claim.

RIME-LMDG remains a pinned real-world validation lane. Its LTS models are about
420 MB each and are CC-BY-4.0, so they remain external by URL/checksum/license
evidence rather than checked-in model data. The evidence records the explicit
attribution notice: RIME-LMDG by amzxyz, source
`https://github.com/amzxyz/RIME-LMDG`, licensed CC-BY-4.0.

## Post-Closeout Residual Cleanup

The post-merge residual cleanup aligns Yune's octagram lookup with librime's
raw `GramDb::kMaxResults` behavior by searching from the matched context node
and limiting raw Darts prefix results before scoring. It also makes the
RIME-LMDG CC-BY attribution explicit in the fixture and evidence metadata,
despite not vendoring the full model.
