## What Yune Does

You type romanized Chinese (Pinyin for Mandarin, Jyutping for Cantonese) on a
standard keyboard. Yune converts it to the right Chinese characters in real time.

Under the hood, Yune reads the same dictionary and configuration files as
[RIME](https://rime.im) — the most widely used open-source Chinese input-method
engine. This means it works with the thousands of existing RIME schemas and
dictionaries that the community has built over the years.

**[yune-web.pages.dev](https://yune-web.pages.dev)** — try it in your browser.

### Capabilities

- RIME schema and config handling: `__include`, `__patch`, custom patches, deploy
  freshness, schema installation, and schema switching.
- Full input pipeline: speller, selector, navigator, key binder, editor, ASCII
  composer, chord composer, punctuation, recognizer, translators, and filters.
- Dictionary support: source `.dict.yaml`, imports, Yune-native compiled
  table/prism/reverse artifacts, rebuild execution, and fixture-backed ranking
  verified against the reference engine.
- C ABI compatibility: upstream-shaped default `RimeApi` and `RimeLeversApi`,
  config/context/candidate/session/deploy APIs, dynamic-loader tests, and
  frontend lifecycle tests.
- TypeDuck profile behavior: fork-only ABI slots exposed through
  `rime_get_typeduck_profile_api()`, rich Cantonese dictionary comments, and
  TypeDuck-Web/Windows compatibility evidence.
- Browser runtime: `@yune-ime/yune-web-runtime`, the `yune-web` Vite app,
  multi-schema browser harness, public demo, and Playwright evidence.
- AI foundation: provider trait, local/mock providers, staged AI rows, privacy
  policy, separate AI memory, and default-off browser exposure.

## Why It Exists

RIME has been the backbone of open-source Chinese input for over a decade. It
works well. But it's a large C++ codebase that's difficult to change, test, or
embed in modern environments like browsers and mobile apps.

Yune rebuilds the engine from scratch in Rust with three goals:

**Run everywhere.** The same core engine compiles to a native shared library
(for desktop IMEs like Squirrel, Weasel, or ibus-rime), to WebAssembly (for
browser-based input), or to a CLI tool (for testing and benchmarking).

**Be testable.** Every behavior is verified byte-for-byte against the real RIME
engine. Instead of porting C++ code (and inheriting its bugs and assumptions),
Yune runs RIME as a "behavior oracle": capture what it outputs for a given
input, then assert Yune produces the exact same result. This preserves
compatibility without cargo-culting a 15-year-old C++ architecture.

**Prepare for AI-native input.** The engine has a built-in, default-off AI layer.
In the future, an on-device language model could suggest completions or
corrections alongside traditional dictionary candidates — without slowing down
the classic path and without sending your typing to a cloud service.

## How It Works

```
keystrokes  ──►  spelling algebra  ──►  dictionary lookup  ──►  ranking & filtering  ──►  commit text
                    (normalize)          (find candidates)        (sort, deduplicate)        (output)
```

The pipeline is built from swappable Rust traits — translators, filters, and
rankers — rather than a monolithic class hierarchy. Want to plug in a custom
ranking model? Implement a trait. Want a different dictionary format? Swap the
translator.

Everything runs in safe Rust. The workspace enforces `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.

## Current Status

Yune is an active engine project.

- **Compatibility baseline:** Phase 1 is complete. Yune produces identical output
  to RIME 1.17.0 for Mandarin (`luna_pinyin`) and Cantonese (`jyut6ping3` via
  TypeDuck profile). It has been validated as a drop-in replacement in real-world
  frontends (TypeDuck-Web, TypeDuck-Windows).
- **Current work:** milestone M38 targets engine performance parity — closing the
  remaining speed gap against native RIME. Focus areas: native engine startup
  cost, mmap-backed `rsmarisa` table lookup, lazy/page-bounded candidate
  production, context export, memory, and allocation shape — all measured against
  same-run RIME evidence.
- **Public demo:** `yune-web` is deployed at <https://yune-web.pages.dev>. It's
  a Yune engine demo, not a claim that browser-level performance is solved.
- **AI posture:** the AI layer exists but is default-off, local-only in the web
  harness, and outside the classic deterministic input path.

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the detailed milestone plan.

## Compatibility

Yune's compatibility is target-driven, not checklist-driven.

**Reference engines** (the "oracles" that define correct behavior):

- Default core oracle: upstream `rime/librime 1.17.0`
  (`33e78140250125871856cdc5b42ddc6a5fcd3cd4`).
- TypeDuck profile oracle: TypeDuck-HK/librime `v1.1.2`
  (`74cb52b78fb2411137a7643f6c8bc6517acfde69`).

**Rules:**

- Preserve upstream-observable behavior for named targets.
- Isolate TypeDuck fork behavior behind the TypeDuck profile surface.
- Add librime features only when a named target needs them.
- Keep expected bytes non-circular: always capture them from the relevant oracle,
  never derive them from Yune itself.

Default `rime_get_api()` remains upstream-shaped. TypeDuck fork-only ABI slots
are exposed exclusively through `rime_get_typeduck_profile_api()`.

## Performance

Yune treats RIME as a behavioral and performance comparison point, but does not
claim current typing-speed, memory-footprint, or browser-speed wins. Milestones
M33-M37 removed several real costs. M38 is now focused on closing the remaining
native engine gap with measured, same-run evidence.

Current reports:

- [docs/reports/yune-vs-librime-root-cause-analysis.md](docs/reports/yune-vs-librime-root-cause-analysis.md)

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Rust 1.76 or newer
- Node.js and npm (for the browser harness and TypeScript runtime)
- Emscripten (only if building the WASM artifact locally)

Build and test:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test --workspace
```

Feed keystrokes directly to the core engine:

```bash
cargo run -p yune-cli -- run "nihao "
```

Run against real RIME data through the full ABI path:

```bash
cargo run -p yune-cli -- frontend \
  --shared-data-dir ./path/to/rime-data \
  --user-data-dir ./tmp/yune-user \
  --schema luna_pinyin \
  --sequence "nihao "
```

Run the browser demo locally:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/yune-web install
npm --prefix apps/yune-web run build
npm --prefix apps/yune-web run start
```

For browser validation work, start with
[apps/yune-web/e2e/yune-browser-smoke.md](apps/yune-web/e2e/yune-browser-smoke.md).

## Quality Checks

Run these before merging significant changes:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
npm --prefix packages/yune-web-runtime test
npm --prefix packages/yune-web-runtime run build
```

Browser-visible claims need Playwright or equivalent real-browser evidence.

## Non-Goals

Equally important as the goals — these are things Yune intentionally does not do:

- Bit-for-bit librime internals or full C++ plugin ABI parity.
- A broad librime feature checklist without a named target.
- Widening the default upstream `RimeApi` for TypeDuck-only behavior.
- Cloud inference as a hard dependency.
- Remote AI providers without explicit privacy and product gates.
- Claiming application/browser performance wins from native engine evidence.

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature proposals, and pull requests are welcome. For anything that
affects behavioral compatibility, include oracle-captured evidence (real RIME
output against the same input — expected values must not be derived from Yune
itself). Start with [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md) for architecture
and coding rules.
