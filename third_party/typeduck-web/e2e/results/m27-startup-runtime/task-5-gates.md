# M27 Task 5 Gates

> **Status:** Passed - **Milestone:** M27 (TypeDuck-Web startup/runtime init) - **Updated:** 2026-06-22 - **Type:** evidence

M27 closeout was verified on Windows after the startup optimization, worker evidence marker, AI-control loading fix, TypeDuck-Web patch regeneration, and release WASM rebuild.

## Closeout Notes

- Native startup attribution now records observable startup owners plus Windows working-set and peak-working-set metrics.
- The evidenced top owner, `spelling_algebra_expand`, was reduced by caching expanded code variants per original code before candidate materialization.
- Browser startup evidence improved from the M26 baseline of about `10.7s` fresh / `10.4s` reload to `5.680s` fresh / `5.466s` reload after the release WASM rebuild.
- AI Candidates no longer use the page-wide loading wrapper and do not emit deploy or runtime reinitialization markers; deploy-backed controls remain classified separately.
