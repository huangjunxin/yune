## Evidence

- Oracle fixture: `crates/yune-core/tests/fixtures/typeduck-v1.1.2/jyut6ping3-m28-partial-selection.json`.
- History classification: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m28-partial-selection/history-classification.md`.
- Oracle capture: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m28-partial-selection/oracle-capture.md`.
- Browser evidence: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m28-partial-selection/browser-evidence.md`.
- Browser JSON: `third_party/typeduck-web/e2e/results/m28-partial-selection/browser-partial-selection.json`.

## Result

M28 is complete as a separate engine-correctness milestone. Selecting the prefix candidate `測` commits only the consumed span, keeps the remaining input composing, preserves FORK-PARITY-03 whole-sentence learning, and records browser evidence that the raw tail is not inserted.
